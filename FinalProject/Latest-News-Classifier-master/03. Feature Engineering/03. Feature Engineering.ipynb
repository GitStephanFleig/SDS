       "'\\r\\n      \\r\\n      Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:\\r\\n\\r\\nLess than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American People—and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new Administration had already taken swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission—to make America great again for all Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America’s soul, and the steel in America’s spine.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe saw the volunteers of the “Cajun Navy,” racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water, to help save more than 40 lives. Thank you, Ashlee.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He is here with us too. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by wildfires.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California, and everywhere else—we are with you, we love you, and we will pull through together.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House—a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police Officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life, and the lives of many others in this room.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there is a challenge, we tame it. If there is an opportunity, we seize it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value. That is great news for Americans’ 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. We also doubled the child tax credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nA typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000k—slashing their tax bill in half.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system—and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year—forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare—the individual mandate is now gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing—a small business in Ohio. They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of Staub’s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax‑cut raise into his new home and his two daughters’ education. Please join me in congratulating Corey.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses—many of them thousands of dollars per worker. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo to every citizen watching at home tonight—no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of Nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether, we are rediscovering the American way.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life. Our motto is “in God we trust.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans’ graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston: a job well done.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. Preston’s reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmericans love their country. And they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorking with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions. Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my Administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve—and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Americans deserve accountability and respect—and that is what we are giving them. So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers—and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have ended the war on American Energy—and we have ended the war on clean coal. We are now an exporter of energy to the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America’s autoworkers—so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once again.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States—something we have not seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama. Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country. This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing—for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are coming back.\\r\\n\\r\\nExciting progress is happening every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure—I want to give them a chance right here at home. It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the “right to try.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. That is why I have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities. Prices will come down.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation’s wealth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe era of economic surrender is over.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerica is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year—is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road?\\r\\n\\r\\nI am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment—to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process—getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one.\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether, we can reclaim our building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land. And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe want every American to know the dignity of a hard day’s work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training. Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nStruggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans.  Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters—Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens—were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa’s 16th Birthday, neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa’s murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors—and wound up in Kayla and Nisa’s high school.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert:  Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. And 320 million hearts are breaking for you. We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, so that this cannot ever happen again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America’s children, America’s struggling workers, and America’s forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties—Democrats and Republicans—to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans—to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country: Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez—he goes by CJ. CJ served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets. At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ’s murder. But he did not cave to threats or fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13.\\r\\n\\r\\nCJ: Great work. Now let us get the Congress to send you some reinforcements.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise—one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are the four pillars of our plan:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age—that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country—and it finally ends the dangerous practice of “catch and release.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third pillar ends the visa lottery—a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people. It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system—one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first. So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day. Seven per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy Administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult—but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca. Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: “You will do it—because you can.” He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan and Rebecca: You embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you, and congratulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we rebuild America’s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression. Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nClearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery.\\r\\n\\r\\nKenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin’s selfless love for a fellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. Raqqa is liberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a “V” for “Valor.” Staff Sergeant Peck:  All of America salutes you.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield—including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo today, I am keeping another promise. I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al-Qa’ida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists—wherever we chase them down.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before: I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America’s sovereign right to make this recognition. American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America’s friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening.\\r\\n\\r\\nPast experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June—horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtto’s Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight—along with Otto’s brother and sister, Austin and Greta. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all. Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto’s memory with American resolve.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves—permanently stunting their own growth. Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians. He had—and he resolved to be free.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most—the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeong-ho’s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves. That they could chart their own destiny. And that, together, they could light up the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.\\r\\n\\r\\nAtop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonuments to Washington and Jefferson—to Lincoln and King.\\r\\n\\r\\nMemorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga—to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond. And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol. This living monument to the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nA people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us—defending hope, pride, and the American way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. They are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmericans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. And it is the people who are making America great again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur families will thrive.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur people will prosper.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, and God bless America.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\\r\\nJanuary 30, 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n    '"

       "'\\r\\n      \\r\\n      Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:\\r\\n\\r\\nToday in America, a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it, and did her part to lift America’s graduation rate to its highest level in more than three decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup, and did her part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn autoworker fine-tuned some of the best, most fuel-efficient cars in the world, and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nA farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five-year stretch of farm exports in our history.  A rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford.  A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired but dreaming big dreams for his son.  And in tight-knit communities across America, fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm around their spouse, remember fallen comrades, and give thanks for being home from a war that, after twelve long years, is finally coming to an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent: it is you, our citizens, who make the state of our union strong.\\r\\n\\r\\n Here are the results of your efforts:  The lowest unemployment rate in over five years.  A rebounding housing market.  A manufacturing sector that’s adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s.  More oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly twenty years.  Our deficits – cut by more than half.  And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world’s number one place to invest; America is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America.  After five years of grit and determined effort, the United States is better-positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question for everyone in this chamber, running through every decision we make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress.  For several years now, this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government.  It’s an important debate – one that dates back to our very founding.  But when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy – when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States – then we are not doing right by the American people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs President, I’m committed to making Washington work better, and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here.  I believe most of you are, too.  Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans, this Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year’s severe cuts to priorities like education.  Nobody got everything they wanted, and we can still do more to invest in this country’s future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way.  But the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs, not creating new crises.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the coming months, let’s see where else we can make progress together.  Let’s make this a year of action.  That’s what most Americans want – for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations.  And what I believe unites the people of this nation, regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or poor, is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all – the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s face it: that belief has suffered some serious blows.  Over more than three decades, even before the Great Recession hit, massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good, middle-class jobs, and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, after four years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better.  But average wages have barely budged.  Inequality has deepened.  Upward mobility has stalled.  The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by – let alone get ahead.  And too many still aren’t working at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur job is to reverse these trends.  It won’t happen right away, and we won’t agree on everything.  But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class.  Some require Congressional action, and I’m eager to work with all of you.  But America does not stand still – and neither will I.  So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that’s what I’m going to do. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs usual, our First Lady sets a good example.  Michelle’s Let’s Move partnership with schools, businesses, and local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years – an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come.  The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400,000 veterans and military spouses.  Taking a page from that playbook, the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit where already, 150 universities, businesses, and nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education – and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus.  Across the country, we’re partnering with mayors, governors, and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe point is, there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments, and are moving this country forward.  They believe, and I believe, that here in America, our success should depend not on accident of birth, but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams.  That’s what drew our forebears here.  It’s how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America’s largest automaker; how the son of a barkeeper is Speaker of the House; how the son of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth. \\r\\n\\r\\nOpportunity is who we are.  And the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know where to start: the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job.  With the economy picking up speed, companies say they intend to hire more people this year.  And over half of big manufacturers say they’re thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo let’s make that decision easier for more companies.  Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward companies that keep profits abroad.  Let’s flip that equation.  Let’s work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes – because in today’s global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure.  We’ll need Congress to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer.  But I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs.  My administration has launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in Raleigh and Youngstown, where we’ve connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies.  Tonight, I’m announcing we’ll launch six more this year.  Bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create.  So get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in America.  Over the past five years, my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other.  And when ninety-eight percent of our exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia-Pacific will help them create more jobs.  We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment, and open new markets to new goods stamped “Made in the USA.”  China and Europe aren’t standing on the sidelines.  Neither should we.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow.  This is an edge America cannot surrender.  Federally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones.  That’s why Congress should undo the damage done by last year’s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery – whether it’s vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria, or paper-thin material that’s stronger than steel.  And let’s pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly, needless litigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy.  The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the reasons why is natural gas – if extracted safely, it’s the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change.  Businesses plan to invest almost $100 billion in new factories that use natural gas.  I’ll cut red tape to help states get those factories built, and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas.  My administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air, our water, and our communities.  And while we’re at it, I’ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s not just oil and natural gas production that’s booming; we’re becoming a global leader in solar, too.  Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can’t be outsourced.  Let’s continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don’t need it, so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd even as we’ve increased energy production, we’ve partnered with businesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we consume.  When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars.  In the coming months, I’ll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks, so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet.  Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.  But we have to act with more urgency – because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods. That’s why I directed my administration to work with states, utilities, and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air.  The shift to a cleaner energy economy won’t happen overnight, and it will require tough choices along the way.  But the debate is settled.  Climate change is a fact.  And when our children’s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to sayyes, we did.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, if we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement – and fix our broken immigration system.  Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted.  I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same.  Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades.  And for good reason: when people come here to fulfill their dreams – to study, invent, and contribute to our culture – they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone.  So let’s get immigration reform done this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ideas I’ve outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs.  But in this rapidly-changing economy, we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news is, we know how to do it.  Two years ago, as the auto industry came roaring back, Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit.  She knew that Ford needed parts for the best-selling truck in America, and she knew how to make them.  She just needed the workforce.  So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center – places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job, or better job.  She was flooded with new workers.  And today, Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer – and every job seeker.  So tonight, I’ve asked Vice President Biden to lead an across-the-board reform of America’s training programs to make sure they have one mission: train Americans with the skills employers need, and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now.  That means more on-the-job training, and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life.  It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs.  And if Congress wants to help, you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it’s more effective in today’s economy.  But first, this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me tell you why.\\r\\n\\r\\nMisty DeMars is a mother of two young boys. She’d been steadily employed since she was a teenager.  She put herself through college.  She’d never collected unemployment benefits.  In May, she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home.  A week later, budget cuts claimed the job she loved.  Last month, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and wrote me a letter – the kind I get every day.  “We are the face of the unemployment crisis,” she wrote.  “I am not dependent on the government…Our country depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to society…care about our neighbors…I am confident that in time I will find a job…I will pay my taxes, and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love.  Please give us this chance.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress, give these hardworking, responsible Americans that chance.  They need our help, but more important, this country needs them in the game.  That’s why I’ve been asking CEOs to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families; this week, many will come to the White House to make that commitment real.  Tonight, I ask every business leader in America to join us and to do the same – because we are stronger when America fields a full team. \\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, it’s not enough to train today’s workforce.  We also have to prepare tomorrow’s workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstiven Rodriguez couldn’t speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age nine.  But last month, thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a march of his classmates – through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors – from their high school to the post office, where they mailed off their college applications.  And this son of a factory worker just found out he’s going to college this fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids.  We worked with lenders to reform student loans, and today, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before.  Race to the Top, with the help of governors from both parties, has helped states raise expectations and performance.  Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. are making big strides in preparing students with skills for the new economy – problem solving, critical thinking, science, technology, engineering, and math.  Some of this change is hard.  It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test.  But it’s worth it – and it’s working. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem is we’re still not reaching enough kids, and we’re not reaching them in time.  That has to change. \\r\\n\\r\\nResearch shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child’s life is high-quality early education.  Last year, I asked this Congress to help states make high-quality pre-K available to every four year-old.  As a parent as well as a President, I repeat that request tonight. But in the meantime, thirty states have raised pre-k funding on their own.  They know we can’t wait.  So just as we worked with states to reform our schools, this year, we’ll invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children.  And as Congress decides what it’s going to do, I’m going to pull together a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-K they need.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years.  Tonight, I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint, and Verizon, we’ve got a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years, without adding a dime to the deficit. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that can lead directly to a job and career.  We’re shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information, and colleges more incentives to offer better value, so that no middle-class kid is priced out of a college education.  We’re offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income, and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt.  And I’m reaching out to some of America’s leading foundations and corporations on a new initiativeto help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bottom line is, Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance this country gave us.  But we know our opportunity agenda won’t be complete – and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the American Dream as an empty promise – unless we do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work, and hard work pays off for every single American. \\r\\n\\r\\nToday, women make up about half our workforce.  But they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.  That is wrong, and in 2014, it’s an embarrassment. A woman deserves equal pay for equal work.  She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job.  A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship – and you know what, a father does, too.  It’s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a “Mad Men” episode.  This year, let’s all come together – Congress, the White House, and businesses from Wall Street to Main Street – to give every woman the opportunity she deserves.  Because I firmly believe when women succeed, America succeeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, women hold a majority of lower-wage jobs – but they’re not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages.  Americans understand that some people will earn more than others, and we don’t resent those who, by virtue of their efforts, achieve incredible success.  But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, five states have passed laws to raise theirs.  Many businesses have done it on their own.  Nick Chute is here tonight with his boss, John Soranno.  John’s an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps make the dough.  Only now he makes more of it: John just gave his employees a raise, to ten bucks an hour – a decision that eased their financial stress and boosted their morale.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, I ask more of America’s business leaders to follow John’s lead and do what you can to raise your employees’ wages.  To every mayor, governor, and state legislator in America, I say, you don’t have to wait for Congress to act; Americans will support you if you take this on.  And as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example. Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover. We should too.  In the coming weeks, I will issue an Executive Order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour – because if you cook our troops’ meals or wash their dishes, you shouldn’t have to live in poverty.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, to reach millions more, Congress needs to get on board. Today, the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here.  Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10.10.  This will help families.  It will give businesses customers with more money to spend.  It doesn’t involve any new bureaucratic program.  So join the rest of the country.  Say yes.  Give America a raise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Right now, it helps about half of all parents at some point.  But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn’t do enough for single workers who don’t have kids.  So let’s work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, and help more Americans get ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today, most workers don’t have a pension.  A Social Security check often isn’t enough on its own.  And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years, that doesn’t help folks who don’t have 401ks.  That’s why, tomorrow, I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings: MyRA. It’s a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg.  MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.  And if this Congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little to nothing for middle-class Americans.  Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job, so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can.  And since the most important investment many families make is their home, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again, and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of Americans.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne last point on financial security.  For decades, few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system.  And in case you haven’t heard, we’re in the process of fixing that.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pre-existing condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley, a physician assistant and single mom from Arizona, couldn’t get health insurance.  But on January 1st, she got covered.  On January 3rd, she felt a sharp pain.  On January 6th, she had emergency surgery.  Just one week earlier, Amanda said, that surgery would’ve meant bankruptcy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s what health insurance reform is all about – the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don’t have to lose everything. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlready, because of the Affordable Care Act, more than three million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents’ plans.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than nine million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here’s another number: zero.  Because of this law, no American can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma, back pain, or cancer. No woman can ever be charged more just because she’s a woman.  And we did all this while adding years to Medicare’s finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I don’t expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law.  But I know that the American people aren’t interested in refighting old battles.  So again, if you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, and increase choice – tell America what you’d do differently.  Let’s see if the numbers add up.  But let’s not have another forty-something votes to repeal a law that’s already helping millions of Americans like Amanda.  The first forty were plenty.  We got it.  We all owe it to the American people to say what we’re for, not just what we’re against. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who’s here tonight.  Kentucky’s not the most liberal part of the country, but he’s like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth’s families.  “They are our friends and neighbors,” he said.  “They are people we shop and go to church with…farmers out on the tractors…grocery clerks…they are people who go to work every morning praying they don’t get sick.  No one deserves to live that way.” \\r\\n\\r\\nSteve’s right.  That’s why, tonight, I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st.  Moms, get on your kids to sign up.  Kids, call your mom and walk her through the application.  It will give her some peace of mind – plus, she’ll appreciate hearing from you. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, that’s the spirit that has always moved this nation forward.  It’s the spirit of citizenship – the recognition that through hard work and responsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizenship means standing up for everyone’s right to vote.  Last year, part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened.  But conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it; and the bipartisan commission I appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote.  Let’s support these efforts.  It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank account, that drives our democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day.  I have seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, and police officers all over this country who say “we are not afraid,” and I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters, shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook.\\r\\n\\r\\nCitizenship demands a sense of common cause; participation in the hard work of self-government; an obligation to serve to our communities.  And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the United States is more secure.  When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, all our troops are out of Iraq.  More than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan.  With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have moved to a support role. Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and America’s longest war will finally be over.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future.  If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions: training and assisting Afghan forces, and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al Qaeda.  For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is, that danger remains.  While we have put al Qaeda’s core leadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved, as al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world. In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, and Mali, we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks. In Syria, we’ll support the opposition that rejects  the agenda of terrorist networks. Here at home, we’ll keep strengthening our defenses, and combat new threats like cyberattacks.  And as we reform our defense budget, we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform, and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to remain vigilant.  But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone. As Commander-in-Chief, I have used force when needed to protect the American people, and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office.  But I will not send our troops into harm’s way unless it’s truly necessary; nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts.  We must fight the battles that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us – large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks – through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners – America must move off a permanent war footing.  That’s why I’ve imposed prudent limits on the use of drones – for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence.  That’s why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs – because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated.  And with the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay – because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action, but by remaining true to our Constitutional ideals, and setting an example for the rest of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou see, in a world of complex threats, our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power – including strong and principled diplomacy.  American diplomacy has rallied more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands, and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles.  American diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria’s chemical weapons are being eliminated, and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve – a future free of dictatorship, terror and fear. As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel – a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the progress of Iran’s nuclear program – and rolled parts of that program back – for the very first time in a decade.  As we gather here tonight, Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium.  It is not installing advanced centrifuges.  Unprecedented inspections help the world verify, every day, that Iran is not building a bomb.  And with our allies and partners, we’re engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese negotiations will be difficult.  They may not succeed.  We are clear-eyed about Iran’s support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, which threaten our allies; and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away.  But these negotiations do not rely on trust; any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb.  If John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible.  But let me be clear: if this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it.  For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed.  If Iran’s leaders do not seize this opportunity, then I will be the first to call for more sanctions, and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon.  But if Iran’s leaders do seize the chance, then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, let’s remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe – to forge greater cooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want.  And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known.  From Tunisia to Burma, we’re supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy.  In Ukraine, we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully, and have a say in their country’s future.  Across Africa, we’re bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty.  In the Americas, we are building new ties of commerce, but we’re also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people.  And we will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of greater security and prosperity, and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster – as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and were greeted with words like, “We will never forget your kindness” and “God bless America!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do these things because they help promote our long-term security.  And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual orientation.  And next week, the world will see one expression of that commitment – when Team USA marches the red, white, and blue into the Olympic Stadium – and brings home the gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, no other country in the world does what we do.  On every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might – but because of the ideals we stand for, and the burdens we bear to advance them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one knows this better than those who serve in uniform.  As this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life.  We’ll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they’ve earned, and our wounded warriors receive the health care – including the mental health care – that they need.  We’ll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home.  And we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me tell you about one of those families I’ve come to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nI first met Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D-Day.  Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked me through the program – a strong, impressive young man, with an easy manner, sharp as a tack.  We joked around, and took pictures, and I told him to stay in touch.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few months later, on his tenth deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor months, he lay in a coma.  The next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn’t speak; he could barely move.  Over the years, he’s endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, and hours of grueling rehab every day. \\r\\n\\r\\nEven now, Cory is still blind in one eye.  He still struggles on his left side.  But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig, and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger. Day by day, he’s learned to speak again and stand again and walk again – and he’s working toward the day when he can serve his country again. \\r\\n\\r\\n“My recovery has not been easy,” he says. “Nothing in life that’s worth anything is easy.” \\r\\n\\r\\nCory is here tonight.  And like the Army he loves, like the America he serves, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy.  Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy.  Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged.  But for more than two hundred years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress – to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement; to free other nations from tyranny and fear; to promote justice, and fairness, and equality under the law, so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen.  The America we want for our kids – a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong; where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us – none of it is easy.  But if we work together; if we summon what is best in us, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow – I know it’s within our reach. \\r\\n\\r\\nBelieve it.\\r\\n\\r\\nGod bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\n    '"

       "'    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: Today in America, a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it, and did her part to lift America’s graduation rate to its highest level in more than three decades. An entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup, and did her part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years.  An autoworker fine-tuned some of the best, most fuel-efficient cars in the world, and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oil. A farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five-year stretch of farm exports in our history.  A rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford.  A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired but dreaming big dreams for his son.  And in tight-knit communities across America, fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm around their spouse, remember fallen comrades, and give thanks for being home from a war that, after twelve long years, is finally coming to an end. Tonight, this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent: it is you, our citizens, who make the state of our union strong.  Here are the results of your efforts:  The lowest unemployment rate in over five years.  A rebounding housing market.  A manufacturing sector that’s adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s.  More oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly twenty years.  Our deficits – cut by more than half.  And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world’s number one place to invest; America is. That’s why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America.  After five years of grit and determined effort, the United States is better-positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth. The question for everyone in this chamber, running through every decision we make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress.  For several years now, this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government.  It’s an important debate – one that dates back to our very founding.  But when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy – when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States – then we are not doing right by the American people. As President, I’m committed to making Washington work better, and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here.  I believe most of you are, too.  Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans, this Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year’s severe cuts to priorities like education.  Nobody got everything they wanted, and we can still do more to invest in this country’s future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way.  But the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs, not creating new crises. In the coming months, let’s see where else we can make progress together.  Let’s make this a year of action.  That’s what most Americans want – for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations.  And what I believe unites the people of this nation, regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or poor, is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all – the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead. Let’s face it: that belief has suffered some serious blows.  Over more than three decades, even before the Great Recession hit, massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good, middle-class jobs, and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on. Today, after four years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better.  But average wages have barely budged.  Inequality has deepened.  Upward mobility has stalled.  The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by – let alone get ahead.  And too many still aren’t working at all. Our job is to reverse these trends.  It won’t happen right away, and we won’t agree on everything.  But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class.  Some require Congressional action, and I’m eager to work with all of you.  But America does not stand still – and neither will I.  So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that’s what I’m going to do.  As usual, our First Lady sets a good example.  Michelle’s Let’s Move partnership with schools, businesses, and local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years – an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come.  The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400,000 veterans and military spouses.  Taking a page from that playbook, the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit where already, 150 universities, businesses, and nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education – and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus.  Across the country, we’re partnering with mayors, governors, and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality. The point is, there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments, and are moving this country forward.  They believe, and I believe, that here in America, our success should depend not on accident of birth, but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams.  That’s what drew our forebears here.  It’s how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America’s largest automaker; how the son of a barkeeper is Speaker of the House; how the son of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth.  Opportunity is who we are.  And the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise. We know where to start: the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job.  With the economy picking up speed, companies say they intend to hire more people this year.  And over half of big manufacturers say they’re thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad. So let’s make that decision easier for more companies.  Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward companies that keep profits abroad.  Let’s flip that equation.  Let’s work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home. Moreover, we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes – because in today’s global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure.  We’ll need Congress to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer.  But I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible. We also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs.  My administration has launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in Raleigh and Youngstown, where we’ve connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies.  Tonight, I’m announcing we’ll launch six more this year.  Bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create.  So get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to work. Let’s do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in America.  Over the past five years, my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other.  And when ninety-eight percent of our exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia-Pacific will help them create more jobs.  We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment, and open new markets to new goods stamped “Made in the USA.”  China and Europe aren’t standing on the sidelines.  Neither should we. We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow.  This is an edge America cannot surrender.  Federally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones.  That’s why Congress should undo the damage done by last year’s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery – whether it’s vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria, or paper-thin material that’s stronger than steel.  And let’s pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly, needless litigation. Now, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy.  The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades. One of the reasons why is natural gas – if extracted safely, it’s the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change.  Businesses plan to invest almost $100 billion in new factories that use natural gas.  I’ll cut red tape to help states get those factories built, and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas.  My administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air, our water, and our communities.  And while we’re at it, I’ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations. It’s not just oil and natural gas production that’s booming; we’re becoming a global leader in solar, too.  Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can’t be outsourced.  Let’s continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don’t need it, so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do. And even as we’ve increased energy production, we’ve partnered with businesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we consume.  When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars.  In the coming months, I’ll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks, so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump. Taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet.  Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.  But we have to act with more urgency – because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods. That’s why I directed my administration to work with states, utilities, and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air.  The shift to a cleaner energy economy won’t happen overnight, and it will require tough choices along the way.  But the debate is settled.  Climate change is a fact.  And when our children’s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to sayyes, we did. Finally, if we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement – and fix our broken immigration system.  Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted.  I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same.  Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades.  And for good reason: when people come here to fulfill their dreams – to study, invent, and contribute to our culture – they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone.  So let’s get immigration reform done this year. The ideas I’ve outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs.  But in this rapidly-changing economy, we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs. The good news is, we know how to do it.  Two years ago, as the auto industry came roaring back, Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit.  She knew that Ford needed parts for the best-selling truck in America, and she knew how to make them.  She just needed the workforce.  So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center – places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job, or better job.  She was flooded with new workers.  And today, Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees. What Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer – and every job seeker.  So tonight, I’ve asked Vice President Biden to lead an across-the-board reform of America’s training programs to make sure they have one mission: train Americans with the skills employers need, and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now.  That means more on-the-job training, and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life.  It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs.  And if Congress wants to help, you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs. I’m also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it’s more effective in today’s economy.  But first, this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people. Let me tell you why. Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys. She’d been steadily employed since she was a teenager.  She put herself through college.  She’d never collected unemployment benefits.  In May, she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home.  A week later, budget cuts claimed the job she loved.  Last month, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and wrote me a letter – the kind I get every day.  “We are the face of the unemployment crisis,” she wrote.  “I am not dependent on the government…Our country depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to society…care about our neighbors…I am confident that in time I will find a job…I will pay my taxes, and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love.  Please give us this chance.” Congress, give these hardworking, responsible Americans that chance.  They need our help, but more important, this country needs them in the game.  That’s why I’ve been asking CEOs to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families; this week, many will come to the White House to make that commitment real.  Tonight, I ask every business leader in America to join us and to do the same – because we are stronger when America fields a full team.  Of course, it’s not enough to train today’s workforce.  We also have to prepare tomorrow’s workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education. Estiven Rodriguez couldn’t speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age nine.  But last month, thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a march of his classmates – through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors – from their high school to the post office, where they mailed off their college applications.  And this son of a factory worker just found out he’s going to college this fall. Five years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids.  We worked with lenders to reform student loans, and today, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before.  Race to the Top, with the help of governors from both parties, has helped states raise expectations and performance.  Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. are making big strides in preparing students with skills for the new economy – problem solving, critical thinking, science, technology, engineering, and math.  Some of this change is hard.  It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test.  But it’s worth it – and it’s working.  The problem is we’re still not reaching enough kids, and we’re not reaching them in time.  That has to change.  Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child’s life is high-quality early education.  Last year, I asked this Congress to help states make high-quality pre-K available to every four year-old.  As a parent as well as a President, I repeat that request tonight. But in the meantime, thirty states have raised pre-k funding on their own.  They know we can’t wait.  So just as we worked with states to reform our schools, this year, we’ll invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children.  And as Congress decides what it’s going to do, I’m going to pull together a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-K they need. Last year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years.  Tonight, I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint, and Verizon, we’ve got a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years, without adding a dime to the deficit.  We’re working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that can lead directly to a job and career.  We’re shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information, and colleges more incentives to offer better value, so that no middle-class kid is priced out of a college education.  We’re offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income, and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt.  And I’m reaching out to some of America’s leading foundations and corporations on a new initiativeto help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential. The bottom line is, Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance this country gave us.  But we know our opportunity agenda won’t be complete – and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the American Dream as an empty promise – unless we do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work, and hard work pays off for every single American.  Today, women make up about half our workforce.  But they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.  That is wrong, and in 2014, it’s an embarrassment. A woman deserves equal pay for equal work.  She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job.  A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship – and you know what, a father does, too.  It’s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a “Mad Men” episode.  This year, let’s all come together – Congress, the White House, and businesses from Wall Street to Main Street – to give every woman the opportunity she deserves.  Because I firmly believe when women succeed, America succeeds. Now, women hold a majority of lower-wage jobs – but they’re not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages.  Americans understand that some people will earn more than others, and we don’t resent those who, by virtue of their efforts, achieve incredible success.  But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. In the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, five states have passed laws to raise theirs.  Many businesses have done it on their own.  Nick Chute is here tonight with his boss, John Soranno.  John’s an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps make the dough.  Only now he makes more of it: John just gave his employees a raise, to ten bucks an hour – a decision that eased their financial stress and boosted their morale. Tonight, I ask more of America’s business leaders to follow John’s lead and do what you can to raise your employees’ wages.  To every mayor, governor, and state legislator in America, I say, you don’t have to wait for Congress to act; Americans will support you if you take this on.  And as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example. Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover. We should too.  In the coming weeks, I will issue an Executive Order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour – because if you cook our troops’ meals or wash their dishes, you shouldn’t have to live in poverty. Of course, to reach millions more, Congress needs to get on board. Today, the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here.  Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10.10.  This will help families.  It will give businesses customers with more money to spend.  It doesn’t involve any new bureaucratic program.  So join the rest of the country.  Say yes.  Give America a raise. There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Right now, it helps about half of all parents at some point.  But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn’t do enough for single workers who don’t have kids.  So let’s work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, and help more Americans get ahead. Let’s do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today, most workers don’t have a pension.  A Social Security check often isn’t enough on its own.  And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years, that doesn’t help folks who don’t have 401ks.  That’s why, tomorrow, I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings: MyRA. It’s a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg.  MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.  And if this Congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little to nothing for middle-class Americans.  Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job, so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can.  And since the most important investment many families make is their home, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again, and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of Americans. One last point on financial security.  For decades, few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system.  And in case you haven’t heard, we’re in the process of fixing that. A pre-existing condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley, a physician assistant and single mom from Arizona, couldn’t get health insurance.  But on January 1st, she got covered.  On January 3rd, she felt a sharp pain.  On January 6th, she had emergency surgery.  Just one week earlier, Amanda said, that surgery would’ve meant bankruptcy. That’s what health insurance reform is all about – the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don’t have to lose everything.  Already, because of the Affordable Care Act, more than three million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents’ plans. More than nine million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage. And here’s another number: zero.  Because of this law, no American can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma, back pain, or cancer. No woman can ever be charged more just because she’s a woman.  And we did all this while adding years to Medicare’s finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors. Now, I don’t expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law.  But I know that the American people aren’t interested in refighting old battles.  So again, if you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, and increase choice – tell America what you’d do differently.  Let’s see if the numbers add up.  But let’s not have another forty-something votes to repeal a law that’s already helping millions of Americans like Amanda.  The first forty were plenty.  We got it.  We all owe it to the American people to say what we’re for, not just what we’re against.  And if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who’s here tonight.  Kentucky’s not the most liberal part of the country, but he’s like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth’s families.  “They are our friends and neighbors,” he said.  “They are people we shop and go to church with…farmers out on the tractors…grocery clerks…they are people who go to work every morning praying they don’t get sick.  No one deserves to live that way.”  Steve’s right.  That’s why, tonight, I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st.  Moms, get on your kids to sign up.  Kids, call your mom and walk her through the application.  It will give her some peace of mind – plus, she’ll appreciate hearing from you.  After all, that’s the spirit that has always moved this nation forward.  It’s the spirit of citizenship – the recognition that through hard work and responsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well. Citizenship means standing up for everyone’s right to vote.  Last year, part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened.  But conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it; and the bipartisan commission I appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote.  Let’s support these efforts.  It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank account, that drives our democracy. Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day.  I have seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, and police officers all over this country who say “we are not afraid,” and I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters, shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook. Citizenship demands a sense of common cause; participation in the hard work of self-government; an obligation to serve to our communities.  And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. Tonight, because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the United States is more secure.  When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, all our troops are out of Iraq.  More than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan.  With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have moved to a support role. Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and America’s longest war will finally be over. After 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future.  If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions: training and assisting Afghan forces, and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al Qaeda.  For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country. The fact is, that danger remains.  While we have put al Qaeda’s core leadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved, as al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world. In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, and Mali, we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks. In Syria, we’ll support the opposition that rejects  the agenda of terrorist networks. Here at home, we’ll keep strengthening our defenses, and combat new threats like cyberattacks.  And as we reform our defense budget, we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform, and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions. We have to remain vigilant.  But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone. As Commander-in-Chief, I have used force when needed to protect the American people, and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office.  But I will not send our troops into harm’s way unless it’s truly necessary; nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts.  We must fight the battles that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us – large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism. So, even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks – through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners – America must move off a permanent war footing.  That’s why I’ve imposed prudent limits on the use of drones – for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence.  That’s why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs – because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated.  And with the Afghan war ending, this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay – because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action, but by remaining true to our Constitutional ideals, and setting an example for the rest of the world. You see, in a world of complex threats, our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power – including strong and principled diplomacy.  American diplomacy has rallied more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands, and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles.  American diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria’s chemical weapons are being eliminated, and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve – a future free of dictatorship, terror and fear. As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel – a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side. And it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the progress of Iran’s nuclear program – and rolled parts of that program back – for the very first time in a decade.  As we gather here tonight, Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium.  It is not installing advanced centrifuges.  Unprecedented inspections help the world verify, every day, that Iran is not building a bomb.  And with our allies and partners, we’re engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. These negotiations will be difficult.  They may not succeed.  We are clear-eyed about Iran’s support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, which threaten our allies; and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away.  But these negotiations do not rely on trust; any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb.  If John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today. The sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible.  But let me be clear: if this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it.  For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed.  If Iran’s leaders do not seize this opportunity, then I will be the first to call for more sanctions, and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon.  But if Iran’s leaders do seize the chance, then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war. Finally, let’s remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe – to forge greater cooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want.  And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America.  Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known.  From Tunisia to Burma, we’re supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy.  In Ukraine, we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully, and have a say in their country’s future.  Across Africa, we’re bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty.  In the Americas, we are building new ties of commerce, but we’re also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people.  And we will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of greater security and prosperity, and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster – as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and were greeted with words like, “We will never forget your kindness” and “God bless America!” We do these things because they help promote our long-term security.  And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual orientation.  And next week, the world will see one expression of that commitment – when Team USA marches the red, white, and blue into the Olympic Stadium – and brings home the gold. My fellow Americans, no other country in the world does what we do.  On every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might – but because of the ideals we stand for, and the burdens we bear to advance them. No one knows this better than those who serve in uniform.  As this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life.  We’ll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they’ve earned, and our wounded warriors receive the health care – including the mental health care – that they need.  We’ll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home.  And we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families. Let me tell you about one of those families I’ve come to know. I first met Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D-Day.  Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked me through the program – a strong, impressive young man, with an easy manner, sharp as a tack.  We joked around, and took pictures, and I told him to stay in touch. A few months later, on his tenth deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain.  For months, he lay in a coma.  The next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn’t speak; he could barely move.  Over the years, he’s endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, and hours of grueling rehab every day.  Even now, Cory is still blind in one eye.  He still struggles on his left side.  But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig, and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger. Day by day, he’s learned to speak again and stand again and walk again – and he’s working toward the day when he can serve his country again.  “My recovery has not been easy,” he says. “Nothing in life that’s worth anything is easy.”  Cory is here tonight.  And like the Army he loves, like the America he serves, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit.  My fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy.  Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy.  Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged.  But for more than two hundred years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress – to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement; to free other nations from tyranny and fear; to promote justice, and fairness, and equality under the law, so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen.  The America we want for our kids – a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong; where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us – none of it is easy.  But if we work together; if we summon what is best in us, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow – I know it’s within our reach.  Believe it. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.  '"

       "'    mr. speaker, mr. vice president, members of congress, my fellow americans: today in america, a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it, and did her part to lift america’s graduation rate to its highest level in more than three decades. an entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup, and did her part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years.  an autoworker fine-tuned some of the best, most fuel-efficient cars in the world, and did his part to help america wean itself off foreign oil. a farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five-year stretch of farm exports in our history.  a rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford.  a man took the bus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired but dreaming big dreams for his son.  and in tight-knit communities across america, fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm around their spouse, remember fallen comrades, and give thanks for being home from a war that, after twelve long years, is finally coming to an end. tonight, this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent: it is you, our citizens, who make the state of our union strong.  here are the results of your efforts:  the lowest unemployment rate in over five years.  a rebounding housing market.  a manufacturing sector that’s adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s.  more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly twenty years.  our deficits – cut by more than half.  and for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that china is no longer the world’s number one place to invest; america is. that’s why i believe this can be a breakthrough year for america.  after five years of grit and determined effort, the united states is better-positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on earth. the question for everyone in this chamber, running through every decision we make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress.  for several years now, this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government.  it’s an important debate – one that dates back to our very founding.  but when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy – when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the united states – then we are not doing right by the american people. as president, i’m committed to making washington work better, and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here.  i believe most of you are, too.  last month, thanks to the work of democrats and republicans, this congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year’s severe cuts to priorities like education.  nobody got everything they wanted, and we can still do more to invest in this country’s future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way.  but the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs, not creating new crises. in the coming months, let’s see where else we can make progress together.  let’s make this a year of action.  that’s what most americans want – for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations.  and what i believe unites the people of this nation, regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or poor, is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all – the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead. let’s face it: that belief has suffered some serious blows.  over more than three decades, even before the great recession hit, massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good, middle-class jobs, and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on. today, after four years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better.  but average wages have barely budged.  inequality has deepened.  upward mobility has stalled.  the cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many americans are working more than ever just to get by – let alone get ahead.  and too many still aren’t working at all. our job is to reverse these trends.  it won’t happen right away, and we won’t agree on everything.  but what i offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class.  some require congressional action, and i’m eager to work with all of you.  but america does not stand still – and neither will i.  so wherever and whenever i can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more american families, that’s what i’m going to do.  as usual, our first lady sets a good example.  michelle’s let’s move partnership with schools, businesses, and local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years – an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come.  the joining forces alliance that michelle and jill biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400,000 veterans and military spouses.  taking a page from that playbook, the white house just organized a college opportunity summit where already, 150 universities, businesses, and nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education – and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus.  across the country, we’re partnering with mayors, governors, and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality. the point is, there are millions of americans outside washington who are tired of stale political arguments, and are moving this country forward.  they believe, and i believe, that here in america, our success should depend not on accident of birth, but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams.  that’s what drew our forebears here.  it’s how the daughter of a factory worker is ceo of america’s largest automaker; how the son of a barkeeper is speaker of the house; how the son of a single mom can be president of the greatest nation on earth.  opportunity is who we are.  and the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise. we know where to start: the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job.  with the economy picking up speed, companies say they intend to hire more people this year.  and over half of big manufacturers say they’re thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad. so let’s make that decision easier for more companies.  both democrats and republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward companies that keep profits abroad.  let’s flip that equation.  let’s work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home. moreover, we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes – because in today’s global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure.  we’ll need congress to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer.  but i will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible. we also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs.  my administration has launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in raleigh and youngstown, where we’ve connected businesses to research universities that can help america lead the world in advanced technologies.  tonight, i’m announcing we’ll launch six more this year.  bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create.  so get those bills to my desk and put more americans back to work. let’s do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in america.  over the past five years, my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other.  and when ninety-eight percent of our exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships with europe and the asia-pacific will help them create more jobs.  we need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment, and open new markets to new goods stamped “made in the usa.”  china and europe aren’t standing on the sidelines.  neither should we. we know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow.  this is an edge america cannot surrender.  federally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind google and smartphones.  that’s why congress should undo the damage done by last year’s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great american discovery – whether it’s vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria, or paper-thin material that’s stronger than steel.  and let’s pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly, needless litigation. now, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to american energy.  the all-of-the-above energy strategy i announced a few years ago is working, and today, america is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades. one of the reasons why is natural gas – if extracted safely, it’s the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change.  businesses plan to invest almost $100 billion in new factories that use natural gas.  i’ll cut red tape to help states get those factories built, and this congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to american natural gas.  my administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air, our water, and our communities.  and while we’re at it, i’ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations. it’s not just oil and natural gas production that’s booming; we’re becoming a global leader in solar, too.  every four minutes, another american home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can’t be outsourced.  let’s continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don’t need it, so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do. and even as we’ve increased energy production, we’ve partnered with businesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we consume.  when we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars.  in the coming months, i’ll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks, so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump. taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet.  over the past eight years, the united states has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on earth.  but we have to act with more urgency – because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods. that’s why i directed my administration to work with states, utilities, and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air.  the shift to a cleaner energy economy won’t happen overnight, and it will require tough choices along the way.  but the debate is settled.  climate change is a fact.  and when our children’s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, i want us to be able to sayyes, we did. finally, if we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement – and fix our broken immigration system.  republicans and democrats in the senate have acted.  i know that members of both parties in the house want to do the same.  independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades.  and for good reason: when people come here to fulfill their dreams – to study, invent, and contribute to our culture – they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone.  so let’s get immigration reform done this year. the ideas i’ve outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs.  but in this rapidly-changing economy, we have to make sure that every american has the skills to fill those jobs. the good news is, we know how to do it.  two years ago, as the auto industry came roaring back, andra rush opened up a manufacturing firm in detroit.  she knew that ford needed parts for the best-selling truck in america, and she knew how to make them.  she just needed the workforce.  so she dialed up what we call an american job center – places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job, or better job.  she was flooded with new workers.  and today, detroit manufacturing systems has more than 700 employees. what andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer – and every job seeker.  so tonight, i’ve asked vice president biden to lead an across-the-board reform of america’s training programs to make sure they have one mission: train americans with the skills employers need, and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now.  that means more on-the-job training, and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life.  it means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs.  and if congress wants to help, you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs. i’m also convinced we can help americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it’s more effective in today’s economy.  but first, this congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people. let me tell you why. misty demars is a mother of two young boys. she’d been steadily employed since she was a teenager.  she put herself through college.  she’d never collected unemployment benefits.  in may, she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home.  a week later, budget cuts claimed the job she loved.  last month, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and wrote me a letter – the kind i get every day.  “we are the face of the unemployment crisis,” she wrote.  “i am not dependent on the government…our country depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to society…care about our neighbors…i am confident that in time i will find a job…i will pay my taxes, and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love.  please give us this chance.” congress, give these hardworking, responsible americans that chance.  they need our help, but more important, this country needs them in the game.  that’s why i’ve been asking ceos to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families; this week, many will come to the white house to make that commitment real.  tonight, i ask every business leader in america to join us and to do the same – because we are stronger when america fields a full team.  of course, it’s not enough to train today’s workforce.  we also have to prepare tomorrow’s workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education. estiven rodriguez couldn’t speak a word of english when he moved to new york city at age nine.  but last month, thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a march of his classmates – through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors – from their high school to the post office, where they mailed off their college applications.  and this son of a factory worker just found out he’s going to college this fall. five years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids.  we worked with lenders to reform student loans, and today, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before.  race to the top, with the help of governors from both parties, has helped states raise expectations and performance.  teachers and principals in schools from tennessee to washington, d.c. are making big strides in preparing students with skills for the new economy – problem solving, critical thinking, science, technology, engineering, and math.  some of this change is hard.  it requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test.  but it’s worth it – and it’s working.  the problem is we’re still not reaching enough kids, and we’re not reaching them in time.  that has to change.  research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child’s life is high-quality early education.  last year, i asked this congress to help states make high-quality pre-k available to every four year-old.  as a parent as well as a president, i repeat that request tonight. but in the meantime, thirty states have raised pre-k funding on their own.  they know we can’t wait.  so just as we worked with states to reform our schools, this year, we’ll invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children.  and as congress decides what it’s going to do, i’m going to pull together a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-k they need. last year, i also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years.  tonight, i can announce that with the support of the fcc and companies like apple, microsoft, sprint, and verizon, we’ve got a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years, without adding a dime to the deficit.  we’re working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that can lead directly to a job and career.  we’re shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information, and colleges more incentives to offer better value, so that no middle-class kid is priced out of a college education.  we’re offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income, and i want to work with congress to see how we can help even more americans who feel trapped by student loan debt.  and i’m reaching out to some of america’s leading foundations and corporations on a new initiativeto help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential. the bottom line is, michelle and i want every child to have the same chance this country gave us.  but we know our opportunity agenda won’t be complete – and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the american dream as an empty promise – unless we do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work, and hard work pays off for every single american.  today, women make up about half our workforce.  but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.  that is wrong, and in 2014, it’s an embarrassment. a woman deserves equal pay for equal work.  she deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job.  a mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship – and you know what, a father does, too.  it’s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a “mad men” episode.  this year, let’s all come together – congress, the white house, and businesses from wall street to main street – to give every woman the opportunity she deserves.  because i firmly believe when women succeed, america succeeds. now, women hold a majority of lower-wage jobs – but they’re not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages.  americans understand that some people will earn more than others, and we don’t resent those who, by virtue of their efforts, achieve incredible success.  but americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. in the year since i asked this congress to raise the minimum wage, five states have passed laws to raise theirs.  many businesses have done it on their own.  nick chute is here tonight with his boss, john soranno.  john’s an owner of punch pizza in minneapolis, and nick helps make the dough.  only now he makes more of it: john just gave his employees a raise, to ten bucks an hour – a decision that eased their financial stress and boosted their morale. tonight, i ask more of america’s business leaders to follow john’s lead and do what you can to raise your employees’ wages.  to every mayor, governor, and state legislator in america, i say, you don’t have to wait for congress to act; americans will support you if you take this on.  and as a chief executive, i intend to lead by example. profitable corporations like costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover. we should too.  in the coming weeks, i will issue an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour – because if you cook our troops’ meals or wash their dishes, you shouldn’t have to live in poverty. of course, to reach millions more, congress needs to get on board. today, the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when ronald reagan first stood here.  tom harkin and george miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10.10.  this will help families.  it will give businesses customers with more money to spend.  it doesn’t involve any new bureaucratic program.  so join the rest of the country.  say yes.  give america a raise. there are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the earned income tax credit.  right now, it helps about half of all parents at some point.  but i agree with republicans like senator rubio that it doesn’t do enough for single workers who don’t have kids.  so let’s work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, and help more americans get ahead. let’s do more to help americans save for retirement. today, most workers don’t have a pension.  a social security check often isn’t enough on its own.  and while the stock market has doubled over the last five years, that doesn’t help folks who don’t have 401ks.  that’s why, tomorrow, i will direct the treasury to create a new way for working americans to start their own retirement savings: myra. it’s a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg.  myra guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.  and if this congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little to nothing for middle-class americans.  offer every american access to an automatic ira on the job, so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can.  and since the most important investment many families make is their home, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again, and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of americans. one last point on financial security.  for decades, few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system.  and in case you haven’t heard, we’re in the process of fixing that. a pre-existing condition used to mean that someone like amanda shelley, a physician assistant and single mom from arizona, couldn’t get health insurance.  but on january 1st, she got covered.  on january 3rd, she felt a sharp pain.  on january 6th, she had emergency surgery.  just one week earlier, amanda said, that surgery would’ve meant bankruptcy. that’s what health insurance reform is all about – the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don’t have to lose everything.  already, because of the affordable care act, more than three million americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents’ plans. more than nine million americans have signed up for private health insurance or medicaid coverage. and here’s another number: zero.  because of this law, no american can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma, back pain, or cancer. no woman can ever be charged more just because she’s a woman.  and we did all this while adding years to medicare’s finances, keeping medicare premiums flat, and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors. now, i don’t expect to convince my republican friends on the merits of this law.  but i know that the american people aren’t interested in refighting old battles.  so again, if you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, and increase choice – tell america what you’d do differently.  let’s see if the numbers add up.  but let’s not have another forty-something votes to repeal a law that’s already helping millions of americans like amanda.  the first forty were plenty.  we got it.  we all owe it to the american people to say what we’re for, not just what we’re against.  and if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to governor steve beshear of kentucky, who’s here tonight.  kentucky’s not the most liberal part of the country, but he’s like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth’s families.  “they are our friends and neighbors,” he said.  “they are people we shop and go to church with…farmers out on the tractors…grocery clerks…they are people who go to work every morning praying they don’t get sick.  no one deserves to live that way.”  steve’s right.  that’s why, tonight, i ask every american who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by march 31st.  moms, get on your kids to sign up.  kids, call your mom and walk her through the application.  it will give her some peace of mind – plus, she’ll appreciate hearing from you.  after all, that’s the spirit that has always moved this nation forward.  it’s the spirit of citizenship – the recognition that through hard work and responsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but still come together as one american family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well. citizenship means standing up for everyone’s right to vote.  last year, part of the voting rights act was weakened.  but conservative republicans and liberal democrats are working together to strengthen it; and the bipartisan commission i appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote.  let’s support these efforts.  it should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank account, that drives our democracy. citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day.  i have seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, and police officers all over this country who say “we are not afraid,” and i intend to keep trying, with or without congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent americans in our movie theaters, shopping malls, or schools like sandy hook. citizenship demands a sense of common cause; participation in the hard work of self-government; an obligation to serve to our communities.  and i know this chamber agrees that few americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the united states armed forces. tonight, because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the united states is more secure.  when i took office, nearly 180,000 americans were serving in iraq and afghanistan.  today, all our troops are out of iraq.  more than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from afghanistan.  with afghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have moved to a support role. together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and america’s longest war will finally be over. after 2014, we will support a unified afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future.  if the afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of americans could remain in afghanistan with nato allies to carry out two narrow missions: training and assisting afghan forces, and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al qaeda.  for while our relationship with afghanistan will change, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country. the fact is, that danger remains.  while we have put al qaeda’s core leadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved, as al qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world. in yemen, somalia, iraq, and mali, we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks. in syria, we’ll support the opposition that rejects  the agenda of terrorist networks. here at home, we’ll keep strengthening our defenses, and combat new threats like cyberattacks.  and as we reform our defense budget, we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform, and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions. we have to remain vigilant.  but i strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone. as commander-in-chief, i have used force when needed to protect the american people, and i will never hesitate to do so as long as i hold this office.  but i will not send our troops into harm’s way unless it’s truly necessary; nor will i allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts.  we must fight the battles that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us – large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism. so, even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks – through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners – america must move off a permanent war footing.  that’s why i’ve imposed prudent limits on the use of drones – for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence.  that’s why, working with this congress, i will reform our surveillance programs – because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated.  and with the afghan war ending, this needs to be the year congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at guantanamo bay – because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action, but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals, and setting an example for the rest of the world. you see, in a world of complex threats, our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power – including strong and principled diplomacy.  american diplomacy has rallied more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands, and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on cold war stockpiles.  american diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why syria’s chemical weapons are being eliminated, and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the syrian people deserve – a future free of dictatorship, terror and fear. as we speak, american diplomacy is supporting israelis and palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to achieve dignity and an independent state for palestinians, and lasting peace and security for the state of israel – a jewish state that knows america will always be at their side. and it is american diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the progress of iran’s nuclear program – and rolled parts of that program back – for the very first time in a decade.  as we gather here tonight, iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium.  it is not installing advanced centrifuges.  unprecedented inspections help the world verify, every day, that iran is not building a bomb.  and with our allies and partners, we’re engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. these negotiations will be difficult.  they may not succeed.  we are clear-eyed about iran’s support for terrorist organizations like hezbollah, which threaten our allies; and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away.  but these negotiations do not rely on trust; any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that iran is not building a nuclear bomb.  if john f. kennedy and ronald reagan could negotiate with the soviet union, then surely a strong and confident america can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today. the sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible.  but let me be clear: if this congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, i will veto it.  for the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed.  if iran’s leaders do not seize this opportunity, then i will be the first to call for more sanctions, and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure iran does not build a nuclear weapon.  but if iran’s leaders do seize the chance, then iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war. finally, let’s remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe – to forge greater cooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want.  and no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than america.  our alliance with europe remains the strongest the world has ever known.  from tunisia to burma, we’re supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy.  in ukraine, we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully, and have a say in their country’s future.  across africa, we’re bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty.  in the americas, we are building new ties of commerce, but we’re also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people.  and we will continue to focus on the asia-pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of greater security and prosperity, and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster – as we did in the philippines, when our marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and were greeted with words like, “we will never forget your kindness” and “god bless america!” we do these things because they help promote our long-term security.  and we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual orientation.  and next week, the world will see one expression of that commitment – when team usa marches the red, white, and blue into the olympic stadium – and brings home the gold. my fellow americans, no other country in the world does what we do.  on every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might – but because of the ideals we stand for, and the burdens we bear to advance them. no one knows this better than those who serve in uniform.  as this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life.  we’ll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they’ve earned, and our wounded warriors receive the health care – including the mental health care – that they need.  we’ll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home.  and we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families. let me tell you about one of those families i’ve come to know. i first met cory remsburg, a proud army ranger, at omaha beach on the 65th anniversary of d-day.  along with some of his fellow rangers, he walked me through the program – a strong, impressive young man, with an easy manner, sharp as a tack.  we joked around, and took pictures, and i told him to stay in touch. a few months later, on his tenth deployment, cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in afghanistan. his comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain.  for months, he lay in a coma.  the next time i met him, in the hospital, he couldn’t speak; he could barely move.  over the years, he’s endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, and hours of grueling rehab every day.  even now, cory is still blind in one eye.  he still struggles on his left side.  but slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad craig, and the community around him, cory has grown stronger. day by day, he’s learned to speak again and stand again and walk again – and he’s working toward the day when he can serve his country again.  “my recovery has not been easy,” he says. “nothing in life that’s worth anything is easy.”  cory is here tonight.  and like the army he loves, like the america he serves, sergeant first class cory remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit.  my fellow americans, men and women like cory remind us that america has never come easy.  our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy.  sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged.  but for more than two hundred years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress – to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement; to free other nations from tyranny and fear; to promote justice, and fairness, and equality under the law, so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen.  the america we want for our kids – a rising america where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong; where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us – none of it is easy.  but if we work together; if we summon what is best in us, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow – i know it’s within our reach.  believe it. god bless you, and god bless the united states of america.

rate to its highest level in more than three decades an entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup and did her part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years  an autoworker fine-tuned some of the best most fuel-efficient cars in the world and did his part to help america wean itself off foreign oil a farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five-year stretch of farm exports in our history  a rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford  a man took the bus home from the graveyard shift bone-tired but dreaming big dreams for his son  and in tight-knit communities across america fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids put an arm around their spouse remember fallen comrades and give thanks for being home from a war that after twelve long years is finally coming to an end tonight this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent it is you our citizens who make the state of our union strong  here are the results of your efforts  the lowest unemployment rate in over five years  a rebounding housing market  a manufacturing sector that’s adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s  more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly twenty years  our deficits – cut by more than half  and for the first time in over a decade business leaders around the world have declared that china is no longer the world’s number one place to invest america is that’s why i believe this can be a breakthrough year for america  after five years of grit and determined effort the united states is better-positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on earth the question for everyone in this chamber running through every decision we make this year is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress  for several years now this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government  it’s an important debate – one that dates back to our very founding  but when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy – when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the united states – then we are not doing right by the american people as president i’m committed to making washington work better and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here  i believe most of you are too  last month thanks to the work of democrats and republicans this congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year’s severe cuts to priorities like education  nobody got everything they wanted and we can still do more to invest in this country’s future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way  but the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs not creating new crises in the coming months let’s see where else we can make progress together  let’s make this a year of action  that’s what most americans want – for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives their hopes their aspirations  and what i believe unites the people of this nation regardless of race or region or party young or old rich or poor is the simple profound belief in opportunity for all – the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility you can get ahead let’s face it that belief has suffered some serious blows  over more than three decades even before the great recession hit massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good middle-class jobs and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on today after four years of economic growth corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher and those at the top have never done better  but average wages have barely budged  inequality has deepened  upward mobility has stalled  the cold hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery too many americans are working more than ever just to get by – let alone get ahead  and too many still aren’t working at all our job is to reverse these trends  it won’t happen right away and we won’t agree on everything  but what i offer tonight is a set of concrete practical proposals to speed up growth strengthen the middle class and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class  some require congressional action and i’m eager to work with all of you  but america does not stand still – and neither will i  so wherever and whenever i can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more american families that’s what i’m going to do  as usual our first lady sets a good example  michelle’s let’s move partnership with schools businesses and local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years – an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come  the joining forces alliance that michelle and jill biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400000 veterans and military spouses  taking a page from that playbook the white house just organized a college opportunity summit where already 150 universities businesses and nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education – and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus  across the country we’re partnering with mayors governors and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality the point is there are millions of americans outside washington who are tired of stale political arguments and are moving this country forward  they believe and i believe that here in america our success should depend not on accident of birth but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams  that’s what drew our forebears here  it’s how the daughter of a factory worker is ceo of america’s largest automaker how the son of a barkeeper is speaker of the house how the son of a single mom can be president of the greatest nation on earth  opportunity is who we are  and the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise we know where to start the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job  with the economy picking up speed companies say they intend to hire more people this year  and over half of big manufacturers say they’re thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad so let’s make that decision easier for more companies  both democrats and republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here and reward companies that keep profits abroad  let’s flip that equation  let’s work together to close those loopholes end those incentives to ship jobs overseas and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home moreover we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads upgrading our ports unclogging our commutes – because in today’s global economy first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure  we’ll need congress to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer  but i will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible we also have the chance right now to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs  my administration has launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in raleigh and youngstown where we’ve connected businesses to research universities that can help america lead the world in advanced technologies  tonight i’m announcing we’ll launch six more this year  bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create  so get those bills to my desk and put more americans back to work let’s do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in america  over the past five years my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other  and when ninety-eight percent of our exporters are small businesses new trade partnerships with europe and the asia-pacific will help them create more jobs  we need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers protect our environment and open new markets to new goods stamped “made in the usa”  china and europe aren’t standing on the sidelines  neither should we we know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow  this is an edge america cannot surrender  federally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind google and smartphones  that’s why congress should undo the damage done by last year’s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great american discovery – whether it’s vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria or paper-thin material that’s stronger than steel  and let’s pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation not costly needless litigation now one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to american energy  the all-of-the-above energy strategy i announced a few years ago is working and today america is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades one of the reasons why is natural gas – if extracted safely it’s the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change  businesses plan to invest almost $100 billion in new factories that use natural gas  i’ll cut red tape to help states get those factories built and this congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to american natural gas  my administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air our water and our communities  and while we’re at it i’ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations it’s not just oil and natural gas production that’s booming we’re becoming a global leader in solar too  every four minutes another american home or business goes solar every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can’t be outsourced  let’s continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don’t need it so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do and even as we’ve increased energy production we’ve partnered with businesses builders and local communities to reduce the energy we consume  when we rescued our automakers for example we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars  in the coming months i’ll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump taken together our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner safer planet  over the past eight years the united states has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on earth  but we have to act with more urgency – because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought and coastal cities dealing with floods that’s why i directed my administration to work with states utilities and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air  the shift to a cleaner energy economy won’t happen overnight and it will require tough choices along the way  but the debate is settled  climate change is a fact  and when our children’s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer more stable world with new sources of energy i want us to be able to sayyes we did finally if we are serious about economic growth it is time to heed the call of business leaders labor leaders faith leaders and law enforcement – and fix our broken immigration system  republicans and democrats in the senate have acted  i know that members of both parties in the house want to do the same  independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades  and for good reason when people come here to fulfill their dreams – to study invent and contribute to our culture – they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone  so let’s get immigration reform done this year the ideas i’ve outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs  but in this rapidly-changing economy we have to make sure that every american has the skills to fill those jobs the good news is we know how to do it  two years ago as the auto industry came roaring back andra rush opened up a manufacturing firm in detroit  she knew that ford needed parts for the best-selling truck in america and she knew how to make them  she just needed the workforce  so she dialed up what we call an american job center – places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job or better job  she was flooded with new workers  and today detroit manufacturing systems has more than 700 employees what andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer – and every job seeker  so tonight i’ve asked vice president biden to lead an across-the-board reform of america’s training programs to make sure they have one mission train americans with the skills employers need and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now  that means more on-the-job training and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life  it means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs  and if congress wants to help you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs i’m also convinced we can help americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it’s more effective in today’s economy  but first this congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 16 million people let me tell you why misty demars is a mother of two young boys she’d been steadily employed since she was a teenager  she put herself through college  she’d never collected unemployment benefits  in may she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home  a week later budget cuts claimed the job she loved  last month when their unemployment insurance was cut off she sat down and wrote me a letter – the kind i get every day  “we are the face of the unemployment crisis” she wrote  “i am not dependent on the government…our country depends on people like us who build careers contribute to society…care about our neighbors…i am confident that in time i will find a job…i will pay my taxes and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love  please give us this chance” congress give these hardworking responsible americans that chance  they need our help but more important this country needs them in the game  that’s why i’ve been asking ceos to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families this week many will come to the white house to make that commitment real  tonight i ask every business leader in america to join us and to do the same – because we are stronger when america fields a full team  of course it’s not enough to train today’s workforce  we also have to prepare tomorrow’s workforce by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education estiven rodriguez couldn’t speak a word of english when he moved to new york city at age nine  but last month thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program he led a march of his classmates – through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors – from their high school to the post office where they mailed off their college applications  and this son of a factory worker just found out he’s going to college this fall five years ago we set out to change the odds for all our kids  we worked with lenders to reform student loans and today more young people are earning college degrees than ever before  race to the top with the help of governors from both parties has helped states raise expectations and performance  teachers and principals in schools from tennessee to washington dc are making big strides in preparing students with skills for the new economy – problem solving critical thinking science technology engineering and math  some of this change is hard  it requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test  but it’s worth it – and it’s working  the problem is we’re still not reaching enough kids and we’re not reaching them in time  that has to change  research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child’s life is high-quality early education  last year i asked this congress to help states make high-quality pre-k available to every four year-old  as a parent as well as a president i repeat that request tonight but in the meantime thirty states have raised pre-k funding on their own  they know we can’t wait  so just as we worked with states to reform our schools this year we’ll invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children  and as congress decides what it’s going to do i’m going to pull together a coalition of elected officials business leaders and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-k they need last year i also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years  tonight i can announce that with the support of the fcc and companies like apple microsoft sprint and verizon we’ve got a down payment to start connecting more than 15000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years without adding a dime to the deficit  we’re working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that can lead directly to a job and career  we’re shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information and colleges more incentives to offer better value so that no middle-class kid is priced out of a college education  we’re offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income and i want to work with congress to see how we can help even more americans who feel trapped by student loan debt  and i’m reaching out to some of america’s leading foundations and corporations on a new initiativeto help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential the bottom line is michelle and i want every child to have the same chance this country gave us  but we know our opportunity agenda won’t be complete – and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the american dream as an empty promise – unless we do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work and hard work pays off for every single american  today women make up about half our workforce  but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns  that is wrong and in 2014 it’s an embarrassment a woman deserves equal pay for equal work  she deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job  a mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship – and you know what a father does too  it’s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a “mad men” episode  this year let’s all come together – congress the white house and businesses from wall street to main street – to give every woman the opportunity she deserves  because i firmly believe when women succeed america succeeds now women hold a majority of lower-wage jobs – but they’re not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages  americans understand that some people will earn more than others and we don’t resent those who by virtue of their efforts achieve incredible success  but americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty in the year since i asked this congress to raise the minimum wage five states have passed laws to raise theirs  many businesses have done it on their own  nick chute is here tonight with his boss john soranno  john’s an owner of punch pizza in minneapolis and nick helps make the dough  only now he makes more of it john just gave his employees a raise to ten bucks an hour – a decision that eased their financial stress and boosted their morale tonight i ask more of america’s business leaders to follow john’s lead and do what you can to raise your employees’ wages  to every mayor governor and state legislator in america i say you don’t have to wait for congress to act americans will support you if you take this on  and as a chief executive i intend to lead by example profitable corporations like costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover we should too  in the coming weeks i will issue an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $1010 an hour – because if you cook our troops’ meals or wash their dishes you shouldn’t have to live in poverty of course to reach millions more congress needs to get on board today the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when ronald reagan first stood here  tom harkin and george miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $1010  this will help families  it will give businesses customers with more money to spend  it doesn’t involve any new bureaucratic program  so join the rest of the country  say yes  give america a raise there are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the earned income tax credit  right now it helps about half of all parents at some point  but i agree with republicans like senator rubio that it doesn’t do enough for single workers who don’t have kids  so let’s work together to strengthen the credit reward work and help more americans get ahead let’s do more to help americans save for retirement today most workers don’t have a pension  a social security check often isn’t enough on its own  and while the stock market has doubled over the last five years that doesn’t help folks who don’t have 401ks  that’s why tomorrow i will direct the treasury to create a new way for working americans to start their own retirement savings myra it’s a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg  myra guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in  and if this congress wants to help work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save but does little to nothing for middle-class americans  offer every american access to an automatic ira on the job so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can  and since the most important investment many families make is their home send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of americans one last point on financial security  for decades few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system  and in case you haven’t heard we’re in the process of fixing that a pre-existing condition used to mean that someone like amanda shelley a physician assistant and single mom from arizona couldn’t get health insurance  but on january 1st she got covered  on january 3rd she felt a sharp pain  on january 6th she had emergency surgery  just one week earlier amanda said that surgery would’ve meant bankruptcy that’s what health insurance reform is all about – the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes you don’t have to lose everything  already because of the affordable care act more than three million americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents’ plans more than nine million americans have signed up for private health insurance or medicaid coverage and here’s another number zero  because of this law no american can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma back pain or cancer no woman can ever be charged more just because she’s a woman  and we did all this while adding years to medicare’s finances keeping medicare premiums flat and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors now i don’t expect to convince my republican friends on the merits of this law  but i know that the american people aren’t interested in refighting old battles  so again if you have specific plans to cut costs cover more people and increase choice – tell america what you’d do differently  let’s see if the numbers add up  but let’s not have another forty-something votes to repeal a law that’s already helping millions of americans like amanda  the first forty were plenty  we got it  we all owe it to the american people to say what we’re for not just what we’re against  and if you want to know the real impact this law is having just talk to governor steve beshear of kentucky who’s here tonight  kentucky’s not the most liberal part of the country but he’s like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth’s families  “they are our friends and neighbors” he said  “they are people we shop and go to church with…farmers out on the tractors…grocery clerks…they are people who go to work every morning praying they don’t get sick  no one deserves to live that way”  steve’s right  that’s why tonight i ask every american who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by march 31st  moms get on your kids to sign up  kids call your mom and walk her through the application  it will give her some peace of mind – plus she’ll appreciate hearing from you  after all that’s the spirit that has always moved this nation forward  it’s the spirit of citizenship – the recognition that through hard work and responsibility we can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well citizenship means standing up for everyone’s right to vote  last year part of the voting rights act was weakened  but conservative republicans and liberal democrats are working together to strengthen it and the bipartisan commission i appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote  let’s support these efforts  it should be the power of our vote not the size of our bank account that drives our democracy citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day  i have seen the courage of parents students pastors and police officers all over this country who say “we are not afraid” and i intend to keep trying with or without congress to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent americans in our movie theaters shopping malls or schools like sandy hook citizenship demands a sense of common cause participation in the hard work of self-government an obligation to serve to our communities  and i know this chamber agrees that few americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the united states armed forces tonight because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free the united states is more secure  when i took office nearly 180000 americans were serving in iraq and afghanistan  today all our troops are out of iraq  more than 60000 of our troops have already come home from afghanistan  with afghan forces now in the lead for their own security our troops have moved to a support role together with our allies we will complete our mission there by the end of this year and america’s longest war will finally be over after 2014 we will support a unified afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future  if the afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated a small force of americans could remain in afghanistan with nato allies to carry out two narrow missions training and assisting afghan forces and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al qaeda  for while our relationship with afghanistan will change one thing will not our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country the fact is that danger remains  while we have put al qaeda’s core leadership on a path to defeat the threat has evolved as al qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world in yemen somalia iraq and mali we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks in syria we’ll support the opposition that rejects  the agenda of terrorist networks here at home we’ll keep strengthening our defenses and combat new threats like cyberattacks  and as we reform our defense budget we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions we have to remain vigilant  but i strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone as commander-in-chief i have used force when needed to protect the american people and i will never hesitate to do so as long as i hold this office  but i will not send our troops into harm’s way unless it’s truly necessary nor will i allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts  we must fight the battles that need to be fought not those that terrorists prefer from us – large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism so even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks – through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners – america must move off a permanent war footing  that’s why i’ve imposed prudent limits on the use of drones – for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence  that’s why working with this congress i will reform our surveillance programs – because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence here and abroad that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated  and with the afghan war ending this needs to be the year congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at guantanamo bay – because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the world you see in a world of complex threats our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power – including strong and principled diplomacy  american diplomacy has rallied more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on cold war stockpiles  american diplomacy backed by the threat of force is why syria’s chemical weapons are being eliminated and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the syrian people deserve – a future free of dictatorship terror and fear as we speak american diplomacy is supporting israelis and palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there to achieve dignity and an independent state for palestinians and lasting peace and security for the state of israel – a jewish state that knows america will always be at their side and it is american diplomacy backed by pressure that has halted the progress of iran’s nuclear program – and rolled parts of that program back – for the very first time in a decade  as we gather here tonight iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium  it is not installing advanced centrifuges  unprecedented inspections help the world verify every day that iran is not building a bomb  and with our allies and partners we’re engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share preventing iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon these negotiations will be difficult  they may not succeed  we are clear-eyed about iran’s support for terrorist organizations like hezbollah which threaten our allies and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away  but these negotiations do not rely on trust any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that iran is not building a nuclear bomb  if john f kennedy and ronald reagan could negotiate with the soviet union then surely a strong and confident america can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today the sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible  but let me be clear if this congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks i will veto it  for the sake of our national security we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed  if iran’s leaders do not seize this opportunity then i will be the first to call for more sanctions and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure iran does not build a nuclear weapon  but if iran’s leaders do seize the chance then iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war finally let’s remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe – to forge greater cooperation to expand new markets to free people from fear and want  and no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than america  our alliance with europe remains the strongest the world has ever known  from tunisia to burma we’re supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy  in ukraine we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully and have a say in their country’s future  across africa we’re bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty  in the americas we are building new ties of commerce but we’re also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people  and we will continue to focus on the asia-pacific where we support our allies shape a future of greater security and prosperity and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster – as we did in the philippines when our marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon and were greeted with words like “we will never forget your kindness” and “god bless america” we do these things because they help promote our long-term security  and we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being regardless of race or religion creed or sexual orientation  and next week the world will see one expression of that commitment – when team usa marches the red white and blue into the olympic stadium – and brings home the gold my fellow americans no other country in the world does what we do  on every issue the world turns to us not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might – but because of the ideals we stand for and the burdens we bear to advance them no one knows this better than those who serve in uniform  as this time of war draws to a close a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life  we’ll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they’ve earned and our wounded warriors receive the health care – including the mental health care – that they need  we’ll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home  and we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families let me tell you about one of those families i’ve come to know i first met cory remsburg a proud army ranger at omaha beach on the 65th anniversary of d-day  along with some of his fellow rangers he walked me through the program – a strong impressive young man with an easy manner sharp as a tack  we joked around and took pictures and i told him to stay in touch a few months later on his tenth deployment cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in afghanistan his comrades found him in a canal face down underwater shrapnel in his brain  for months he lay in a coma  the next time i met him in the hospital he couldn’t speak he could barely move  over the years he’s endured dozens of surgeries and procedures and hours of grueling rehab every day  even now cory is still blind in one eye  he still struggles on his left side  but slowly steadily with the support of caregivers like his dad craig and the community around him cory has grown stronger day by day he’s learned to speak again and stand again and walk again – and he’s working toward the day when he can serve his country again  “my recovery has not been easy” he says “nothing in life that’s worth anything is easy”  cory is here tonight  and like the army he loves like the america he serves sergeant first class cory remsburg never gives up and he does not quit  my fellow americans men and women like cory remind us that america has never come easy  our freedom our democracy has never been easy  sometimes we stumble we make mistakes we get frustrated or discouraged  but for more than two hundred years we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress – to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement to free other nations from tyranny and fear to promote justice and fairness and equality under the law so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen  the america we want for our kids – a rising america where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us – none of it is easy  but if we work together if we summon what is best in us with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow – i know it’s within our reach  believe it god bless you and god bless the united states of america  '"

       "'    mr speaker mr vice president members of congress my fellow americans today in america a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it and did her part to lift america’s graduation rate to its highest level in more than three decades an entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup and did her part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years  an autoworker fine-tuned some of the best most fuel-efficient cars in the world and did his part to help america wean itself off foreign oil a farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five-year stretch of farm exports in our history  a rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford  a man took the bus home from the graveyard shift bone-tired but dreaming big dreams for his son  and in tight-knit communities across america fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids put an arm around their spouse remember fallen comrades and give thanks for being home from a war that after twelve long years is finally coming to an end tonight this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent it is you our citizens who make the state of our union strong  here are the results of your efforts  the lowest unemployment rate in over five years  a rebounding housing market  a manufacturing sector that’s adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s  more oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world – the first time that’s happened in nearly twenty years  our deficits – cut by more than half  and for the first time in over a decade business leaders around the world have declared that china is no longer the world’s number one place to invest america is that’s why i believe this can be a breakthrough year for america  after five years of grit and determined effort the united states is better-positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on earth the question for everyone in this chamber running through every decision we make this year is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress  for several years now this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government  it’s an important debate – one that dates back to our very founding  but when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy – when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the united states – then we are not doing right by the american people as president i’m committed to making washington work better and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here  i believe most of you are too  last month thanks to the work of democrats and republicans this congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year’s severe cuts to priorities like education  nobody got everything they wanted and we can still do more to invest in this country’s future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way  but the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs not creating new crises in the coming months let’s see where else we can make progress together  let’s make this a year of action  that’s what most americans want – for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives their hopes their aspirations  and what i believe unites the people of this nation regardless of race or region or party young or old rich or poor is the simple profound belief in opportunity for all – the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility you can get ahead let’s face it that belief has suffered some serious blows  over more than three decades even before the great recession hit massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good middle-class jobs and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on today after four years of economic growth corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher and those at the top have never done better  but average wages have barely budged  inequality has deepened  upward mobility has stalled  the cold hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery too many americans are working more than ever just to get by – let alone get ahead  and too many still aren’t working at all our job is to reverse these trends  it won’t happen right away and we won’t agree on everything  but what i offer tonight is a set of concrete practical proposals to speed up growth strengthen the middle class and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class  some require congressional action and i’m eager to work with all of you  but america does not stand still – and neither will i  so wherever and whenever i can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more american families that’s what i’m going to do  as usual our first lady sets a good example  michelle’s let’s move partnership with schools businesses and local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years – an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come  the joining forces alliance that michelle and jill biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400000 veterans and military spouses  taking a page from that playbook the white house just organized a college opportunity summit where already 150 universities businesses and nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education – and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus  across the country we’re partnering with mayors governors and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality the point is there are millions of americans outside washington who are tired of stale political arguments and are moving this country forward  they believe and i believe that here in america our success should depend not on accident of birth but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams  that’s what drew our forebears here  it’s how the daughter of a factory worker is ceo of america’s largest automaker how the son of a barkeeper is speaker of the house how the son of a single mom can be president of the greatest nation on earth  opportunity is who we are  and the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise we know where to start the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job  with the economy picking up speed companies say they intend to hire more people this year  and over half of big manufacturers say they’re thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad so let’s make that decision easier for more companies  both democrats and republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here and reward companies that keep profits abroad  let’s flip that equation  let’s work together to close those loopholes end those incentives to ship jobs overseas and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home moreover we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads upgrading our ports unclogging our commutes – because in today’s global economy first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure  we’ll need congress to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer  but i will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible we also have the chance right now to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs  my administration has launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in raleigh and youngstown where we’ve connected businesses to research universities that can help america lead the world in advanced technologies  tonight i’m announcing we’ll launch six more this year  bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create  so get those bills to my desk and put more americans back to work let’s do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in america  over the past five years my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other  and when ninety-eight percent of our exporters are small businesses new trade partnerships with europe and the asia-pacific will help them create more jobs  we need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers protect our environment and open new markets to new goods stamped “made in the usa”  china and europe aren’t standing on the sidelines  neither should we we know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow  this is an edge america cannot surrender  federally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind google and smartphones  that’s why congress should undo the damage done by last year’s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great american discovery – whether it’s vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria or paper-thin material that’s stronger than steel  and let’s pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation not costly needless litigation now one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to american energy  the all-of-the-above energy strategy i announced a few years ago is working and today america is closer to energy independence than we’ve been in decades one of the reasons why is natural gas – if extracted safely it’s the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change  businesses plan to invest almost $100 billion in new factories that use natural gas  i’ll cut red tape to help states get those factories built and this congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to american natural gas  my administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air our water and our communities  and while we’re at it i’ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations it’s not just oil and natural gas production that’s booming we’re becoming a global leader in solar too  every four minutes another american home or business goes solar every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can’t be outsourced  let’s continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don’t need it so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do and even as we’ve increased energy production we’ve partnered with businesses builders and local communities to reduce the energy we consume  when we rescued our automakers for example we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars  in the coming months i’ll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump taken together our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner safer planet  over the past eight years the united states has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on earth  but we have to act with more urgency – because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought and coastal cities dealing with floods that’s why i directed my administration to work with states utilities and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air  the shift to a cleaner energy economy won’t happen overnight and it will require tough choices along the way  but the debate is settled  climate change is a fact  and when our children’s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer more stable world with new sources of energy i want us to be able to sayyes we did finally if we are serious about economic growth it is time to heed the call of business leaders labor leaders faith leaders and law enforcement – and fix our broken immigration system  republicans and democrats in the senate have acted  i know that members of both parties in the house want to do the same  independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades  and for good reason when people come here to fulfill their dreams – to study invent and contribute to our culture – they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone  so let’s get immigration reform done this year the ideas i’ve outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs  but in this rapidly-changing economy we have to make sure that every american has the skills to fill those jobs the good news is we know how to do it  two years ago as the auto industry came roaring back andra rush opened up a manufacturing firm in detroit  she knew that ford needed parts for the best-selling truck in america and she knew how to make them  she just needed the workforce  so she dialed up what we call an american job center – places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job or better job  she was flooded with new workers  and today detroit manufacturing systems has more than 700 employees what andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer – and every job seeker  so tonight i’ve asked vice president biden to lead an across-the-board reform of america’s training programs to make sure they have one mission train americans with the skills employers need and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now  that means more on-the-job training and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life  it means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs  and if congress wants to help you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs i’m also convinced we can help americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it’s more effective in today’s economy  but first this congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 16 million people let me tell you why misty demars is a mother of two young boys she’d been steadily employed since she was a teenager  she put herself through college  she’d never collected unemployment benefits  in may she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home  a week later budget cuts claimed the job she loved  last month when their unemployment insurance was cut off she sat down and wrote me a letter – the kind i get every day  “we are the face of the unemployment crisis” she wrote  “i am not dependent on the government…our country depends on people like us who build careers contribute to society…care about our neighbors…i am confident that in time i will find a job…i will pay my taxes and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love  please give us this chance” congress give these hardworking responsible americans that chance  they need our help but more important this country needs them in the game  that’s why i’ve been asking ceos to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families this week many will come to the white house to make that commitment real  tonight i ask every business leader in america to join us and to do the same – because we are stronger when america fields a full team  of course it’s not enough to train today’s workforce  we also have to prepare tomorrow’s workforce by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education estiven rodriguez couldn’t speak a word of english when he moved to new york city at age nine  but last month thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program he led a march of his classmates – through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors – from their high school to the post office where they mailed off their college applications  and this son of a factory worker just found out he’s going to college this fall five years ago we set out to change the odds for all our kids  we worked with lenders to reform student loans and today more young people are earning college degrees than ever before  race to the top with the help of governors from both parties has helped states raise expectations and performance  teachers and principals in schools from tennessee to washington dc are making big strides in preparing students with skills for the new economy – problem solving critical thinking science technology engineering and math  some of this change is hard  it requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test  but it’s worth it – and it’s working  the problem is we’re still not reaching enough kids and we’re not reaching them in time  that has to change  research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child’s life is high-quality early education  last year i asked this congress to help states make high-quality pre-k available to every four year-old  as a parent as well as a president i repeat that request tonight but in the meantime thirty states have raised pre-k funding on their own  they know we can’t wait  so just as we worked with states to reform our schools this year we’ll invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children  and as congress decides what it’s going to do i’m going to pull together a coalition of elected officials business leaders and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-k they need last year i also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years  tonight i can announce that with the support of the fcc and companies like apple microsoft sprint and verizon we’ve got a down payment to start connecting more than 15000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years without adding a dime to the deficit  we’re working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that can lead directly to a job and career  we’re shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information and colleges more incentives to offer better value so that no middle-class kid is priced out of a college education  we’re offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income and i want to work with congress to see how we can help even more americans who feel trapped by student loan debt  and i’m reaching out to some of america’s leading foundations and corporations on a new initiativeto help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential the bottom line is michelle and i want every child to have the same chance this country gave us  but we know our opportunity agenda won’t be complete – and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the american dream as an empty promise – unless we do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work and hard work pays off for every single american  today women make up about half our workforce  but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns  that is wrong and in 2014 it’s an embarrassment a woman deserves equal pay for equal work  she deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job  a mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship – and you know what a father does too  it’s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a “mad men” episode  this year let’s all come together – congress the white house and businesses from wall street to main street – to give every woman the opportunity she deserves  because i firmly believe when women succeed america succeeds now women hold a majority of lower-wage jobs – but they’re not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages  americans understand that some people will earn more than others and we don’t resent those who by virtue of their efforts achieve incredible success  but americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty in the year since i asked this congress to raise the minimum wage five states have passed laws to raise theirs  many businesses have done it on their own  nick chute is here tonight with his boss john soranno  john’s an owner of punch pizza in minneapolis and nick helps make the dough  only now he makes more of it john just gave his employees a raise to ten bucks an hour – a decision that eased their financial stress and boosted their morale tonight i ask more of america’s business leaders to follow john’s lead and do what you can to raise your employees’ wages  to every mayor governor and state legislator in america i say you don’t have to wait for congress to act americans will support you if you take this on  and as a chief executive i intend to lead by example profitable corporations like costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover we should too  in the coming weeks i will issue an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $1010 an hour – because if you cook our troops’ meals or wash their dishes you shouldn’t have to live in poverty of course to reach millions more congress needs to get on board today the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when ronald reagan first stood here  tom harkin and george miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $1010  this will help families  it will give businesses customers with more money to spend  it doesn’t involve any new bureaucratic program  so join the rest of the country  say yes  give america a raise there are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the earned income tax credit  right now it helps about half of all parents at some point  but i agree with republicans like senator rubio that it doesn’t do enough for single workers who don’t have kids  so let’s work together to strengthen the credit reward work and help more americans get ahead let’s do more to help americans save for retirement today most workers don’t have a pension  a social security check often isn’t enough on its own  and while the stock market has doubled over the last five years that doesn’t help folks who don’t have 401ks  that’s why tomorrow i will direct the treasury to create a new way for working americans to start their own retirement savings myra it’s a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg  myra guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in  and if this congress wants to help work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save but does little to nothing for middle-class americans  offer every american access to an automatic ira on the job so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can  and since the most important investment many families make is their home send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of americans one last point on financial security  for decades few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system  and in case you haven’t heard we’re in the process of fixing that a pre-existing condition used to mean that someone like amanda shelley a physician assistant and single mom from arizona couldn’t get health insurance  but on january 1st she got covered  on january 3rd she felt a sharp pain  on january 6th she had emergency surgery  just one week earlier amanda said that surgery would’ve meant bankruptcy that’s what health insurance reform is all about – the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes you don’t have to lose everything  already because of the affordable care act more than three million americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents’ plans more than nine million americans have signed up for private health insurance or medicaid coverage and here’s another number zero  because of this law no american can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma back pain or cancer no woman can ever be charged more just because she’s a woman  and we did all this while adding years to medicare’s finances keeping medicare premiums flat and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors now i don’t expect to convince my republican friends on the merits of this law  but i know that the american people aren’t interested in refighting old battles  so again if you have specific plans to cut costs cover more people and increase choice – tell america what you’d do differently  let’s see if the numbers add up  but let’s not have another forty-something votes to repeal a law that’s already helping millions of americans like amanda  the first forty were plenty  we got it  we all owe it to the american people to say what we’re for not just what we’re against  and if you want to know the real impact this law is having just talk to governor steve beshear of kentucky who’s here tonight  kentucky’s not the most liberal part of the country but he’s like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth’s families  “they are our friends and neighbors” he said  “they are people we shop and go to church with…farmers out on the tractors…grocery clerks…they are people who go to work every morning praying they don’t get sick  no one deserves to live that way”  steve’s right  that’s why tonight i ask every american who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by march 31st  moms get on your kids to sign up  kids call your mom and walk her through the application  it will give her some peace of mind – plus she’ll appreciate hearing from you  after all that’s the spirit that has always moved this nation forward  it’s the spirit of citizenship – the recognition that through hard work and responsibility we can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well citizenship means standing up for everyone’s right to vote  last year part of the voting rights act was weakened  but conservative republicans and liberal democrats are working together to strengthen it and the bipartisan commission i appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote  let’s support these efforts  it should be the power of our vote not the size of our bank account that drives our democracy citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day  i have seen the courage of parents students pastors and police officers all over this country who say “we are not afraid” and i intend to keep trying with or without congress to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent americans in our movie theaters shopping malls or schools like sandy hook citizenship demands a sense of common cause participation in the hard work of self-government an obligation to serve to our communities  and i know this chamber agrees that few americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the united states armed forces tonight because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free the united states is more secure  when i took office nearly 180000 americans were serving in iraq and afghanistan  today all our troops are out of iraq  more than 60000 of our troops have already come home from afghanistan  with afghan forces now in the lead for their own security our troops have moved to a support role together with our allies we will complete our mission there by the end of this year and america’s longest war will finally be over after 2014 we will support a unified afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future  if the afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated a small force of americans could remain in afghanistan with nato allies to carry out two narrow missions training and assisting afghan forces and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al qaeda  for while our relationship with afghanistan will change one thing will not our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country the fact is that danger remains  while we have put al qaeda’s core leadership on a path to defeat the threat has evolved as al qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world in yemen somalia iraq and mali we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks in syria we’ll support the opposition that rejects  the agenda of terrorist networks here at home we’ll keep strengthening our defenses and combat new threats like cyberattacks  and as we reform our defense budget we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions we have to remain vigilant  but i strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone as commander-in-chief i have used force when needed to protect the american people and i will never hesitate to do so as long as i hold this office  but i will not send our troops into harm’s way unless it’s truly necessary nor will i allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts  we must fight the battles that need to be fought not those that terrorists prefer from us – large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism so even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks – through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners – america must move off a permanent war footing  that’s why i’ve imposed prudent limits on the use of drones – for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence  that’s why working with this congress i will reform our surveillance programs – because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence here and abroad that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated  and with the afghan war ending this needs to be the year congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at guantanamo bay – because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the world you see in a world of complex threats our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power – including strong and principled diplomacy  american diplomacy has rallied more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on cold war stockpiles  american diplomacy backed by the threat of force is why syria’s chemical weapons are being eliminated and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the syrian people deserve – a future free of dictatorship terror and fear as we speak american diplomacy is supporting israelis and palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there to achieve dignity and an independent state for palestinians and lasting peace and security for the state of israel – a jewish state that knows america will always be at their side and it is american diplomacy backed by pressure that has halted the progress of iran’s nuclear program – and rolled parts of that program back – for the very first time in a decade  as we gather here tonight iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium  it is not installing advanced centrifuges  unprecedented inspections help the world verify every day that iran is not building a bomb  and with our allies and partners we’re engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share preventing iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon these negotiations will be difficult  they may not succeed  we are clear-eyed about iran’s support for terrorist organizations like hezbollah which threaten our allies and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away  but these negotiations do not rely on trust any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that iran is not building a nuclear bomb  if john f kennedy and ronald reagan could negotiate with the soviet union then surely a strong and confident america can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today the sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible  but let me be clear if this congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks i will veto it  for the sake of our national security we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed  if iran’s leaders do not seize this opportunity then i will be the first to call for more sanctions and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure iran does not build a nuclear weapon  but if iran’s leaders do seize the chance then iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war finally let’s remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe – to forge greater cooperation to expand new markets to free people from fear and want  and no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than america  our alliance with europe remains the strongest the world has ever known  from tunisia to burma we’re supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy  in ukraine we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully and have a say in their country’s future  across africa we’re bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty  in the americas we are building new ties of commerce but we’re also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people  and we will continue to focus on the asia-pacific where we support our allies shape a future of greater security and prosperity and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster – as we did in the philippines when our marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon and were greeted with words like “we will never forget your kindness” and “god bless america” we do these things because they help promote our long-term security  and we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being regardless of race or religion creed or sexual orientation  and next week the world will see one expression of that commitment – when team usa marches the red white and blue into the olympic stadium – and brings home the gold my fellow americans no other country in the world does what we do  on every issue the world turns to us not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might – but because of the ideals we stand for and the burdens we bear to advance them no one knows this better than those who serve in uniform  as this time of war draws to a close a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life  we’ll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they’ve earned and our wounded warriors receive the health care – including the mental health care – that they need  we’ll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home  and we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families let me tell you about one of those families i’ve come to know i first met cory remsburg a proud army ranger at omaha beach on the 65th anniversary of d-day  along with some of his fellow rangers he walked me through the program – a strong impressive young man with an easy manner sharp as a tack  we joked around and took pictures and i told him to stay in touch a few months later on his tenth deployment cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in afghanistan his comrades found him in a canal face down underwater shrapnel in his brain  for months he lay in a coma  the next time i met him in the hospital he couldn’t speak he could barely move  over the years he’s endured dozens of surgeries and procedures and hours of grueling rehab every day  even now cory is still blind in one eye  he still struggles on his left side  but slowly steadily with the support of caregivers like his dad craig and the community around him cory has grown stronger day by day he’s learned to speak again and stand again and walk again – and he’s working toward the day when he can serve his country again  “my recovery has not been easy” he says “nothing in life that’s worth anything is easy”  cory is here tonight  and like the army he loves like the america he serves sergeant first class cory remsburg never gives up and he does not quit  my fellow americans men and women like cory remind us that america has never come easy  our freedom our democracy has never been easy  sometimes we stumble we make mistakes we get frustrated or discouraged  but for more than two hundred years we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress – to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement to free other nations from tyranny and fear to promote justice and fairness and equality under the law so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen  the america we want for our kids – a rising america where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us – none of it is easy  but if we work together if we summon what is best in us with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow – i know it’s within our reach  believe it god bless you and god bless the united states of america  '"

important debate – one that date back to our very found  but when that debate prevent us from carry out even the most basic function of our democracy – when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the unite state – then we be not do right by the american people as president i’m commit to make washington work better and rebuild the trust of the people who send us here  i believe most of you be too  last month thank to the work of democrats and republicans this congress finally produce a budget that undo some of last year’s severe cut to priorities like education  nobody get everything they want and we can still do more to invest in this country’s future while bring down our deficit in a balance way  but the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on create new job not create new crises in the come months let’s see where else we can make progress together  let’s make this a year of action  that’s what most americans want – for all of us in this chamber to focus on their live their hop their aspirations  and what i believe unite the people of this nation regardless of race or region or party young or old rich or poor be the simple profound belief in opportunity for all – the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility you can get ahead let’s face it that belief have suffer some serious blow  over more than three decades even before the great recession hit massive shift in technology and global competition have eliminate a lot of good middle-class job and weaken the economic foundations that families depend on today after four years of economic growth corporate profit and stock price have rarely be higher and those at the top have never do better  but average wag have barely budge  inequality have deepen  upward mobility have stall  the cold hard fact be that even in the midst of recovery too many americans be work more than ever just to get by – let alone get ahead  and too many still aren’t work at all our job be to reverse these trend  it won’t happen right away and we won’t agree on everything  but what i offer tonight be a set of concrete practical proposals to speed up growth strengthen the middle class and build new ladder of opportunity into the middle class  some require congressional action and i’m eager to work with all of you  but america do not stand still – and neither will i  so wherever and whenever i can take step without legislation to expand opportunity for more american families that’s what i’m go to do  as usual our first lady set a good example  michelle’s let’s move partnership with school businesses and local leaders have help bring down childhood obesity rat for the first time in thirty years – an achievement that will improve live and reduce health care cost for decades to come  the join force alliance that michelle and jill biden launch have already encourage employers to hire or train nearly 400000 veterans and military spouses  take a page from that playbook the white house just organize a college opportunity summit where already 150 universities businesses and nonprofits have make concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education – and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus  across the country we’re partner with mayors governors and state legislatures on issue from homelessness to marriage equality the point be there be millions of americans outside washington who be tire of stale political arguments and be move this country forward  they believe and i believe that here in america our success should depend not on accident of birth but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dream  that’s what draw our forebears here  it’s how the daughter of a factory worker be ceo of america’s largest automaker how the son of a barkeeper be speaker of the house how the son of a single mom can be president of the greatest nation on earth  opportunity be who we be  and the define project of our generation be to restore that promise we know where to start the best measure of opportunity be access to a good job  with the economy pick up speed company say they intend to hire more people this year  and over half of big manufacturers say they’re think of insourcing job from abroad so let’s make that decision easier for more company  both democrats and republicans have argue that our tax code be riddle with wasteful complicate loopholes that punish businesses invest here and reward company that keep profit abroad  let’s flip that equation  let’s work together to close those loopholes end those incentives to ship job overseas and lower tax rat for businesses that create job here at home moreover we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create job rebuild our roads upgrade our port unclog our commute – because in today’s global economy first-class job gravitate to first-class infrastructure  we’ll need congress to protect more than three million job by finish transportation and waterways bill this summer  but i will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permit process for key project so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible we also have the chance right now to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacture job  my administration have launch two hubs for high-tech manufacture in raleigh and youngstown where we’ve connect businesses to research universities that can help america lead the world in advance technologies  tonight i’m announce we’ll launch six more this year  bipartisan bill in both house could double the number of these hubs and the job they create  so get those bill to my desk and put more americans back to work let’s do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new job in america  over the past five years my administration have make more loan to small business owners than any other  and when ninety-eight percent of our exporters be small businesses new trade partnerships with europe and the asia-pacific will help them create more job  we need to work together on tool like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers protect our environment and open new market to new goods stamp “made in the usa”  china and europe aren’t stand on the sideline  neither should we we know that the nation that go all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow  this be an edge america cannot surrender  federally-funded research help lead to the ideas and inventions behind google and smartphones  that’s why congress should undo the damage do by last year’s cut to basic research so we can unleash the next great american discovery – whether it’s vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria or paper-thin material that’s stronger than steel  and let’s pass a patent reform bill that allow our businesses to stay focus on innovation not costly needle litigation now one of the biggest factor in bring more job back be our commitment to american energy  the all-of-the-above energy strategy i announce a few years ago be work and today america be closer to energy independence than we’ve be in decades one of the reason why be natural gas – if extract safely it’s the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that cause climate change  businesses plan to invest almost $100 billion in new factories that use natural gas  i’ll cut red tape to help state get those factories build and this congress can help by put people to work build fuel station that shift more cars and truck from foreign oil to american natural gas  my administration will keep work with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthen protection of our air our water and our communities  and while we’re at it i’ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal land for future generations it’s not just oil and natural gas production that’s boom we’re become a global leader in solar too  every four minutes another american home or business go solar every panel pound into place by a worker whose job can’t be outsource  let’s continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stop give $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don’t need it so that we can invest more in fuel of the future that do and even as we’ve increase energy production we’ve partner with businesses builders and local communities to reduce the energy we consume  when we rescue our automakers for example we work with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars  in the come months i’ll build on that success by set new standards for our truck so we can keep drive down oil import and what we pay at the pump take together our energy policy be create job and lead to a cleaner safer planet  over the past eight years the unite state have reduce our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on earth  but we have to act with more urgency – because a change climate be already harm western communities struggle with drought and coastal cities deal with flood that’s why i direct my administration to work with state utilities and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plant be allow to dump into the air  the shift to a cleaner energy economy won’t happen overnight and it will require tough choices along the way  but the debate be settle  climate change be a fact  and when our children’s children look us in the eye and ask if we do all we could to leave them a safer more stable world with new source of energy i want us to be able to sayyes we do finally if we be serious about economic growth it be time to heed the call of business leaders labor leaders faith leaders and law enforcement – and fix our break immigration system  republicans and democrats in the senate have act  i know that members of both party in the house want to do the same  independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades  and for good reason when people come here to fulfill their dream – to study invent and contribute to our culture – they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create job for everyone  so let’s get immigration reform do this year the ideas i’ve outline so far can speed up growth and create more job  but in this rapidly-changing economy we have to make sure that every american have the skills to fill those job the good news be we know how to do it  two years ago as the auto industry come roar back andra rush open up a manufacture firm in detroit  she know that ford need part for the best-selling truck in america and she know how to make them  she just need the workforce  so she dial up what we call an american job center – place where folks can walk in to get the help or train they need to find a new job or better job  she be flood with new workers  and today detroit manufacture systems have more than 700 employees what andra and her employees experience be how it should be for every employer – and every job seeker  so tonight i’ve ask vice president biden to lead an across-the-board reform of america’s train program to make sure they have one mission train americans with the skills employers need and match them to good job that need to be fill right now  that mean more on-the-job train and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life  it mean connect company to community colleges that can help design train to fill their specific need  and if congress want to help you can concentrate fund on prove program that connect more ready-to-work americans with ready-to-be-filled job i’m also convince we can help americans return to the workforce faster by reform unemployment insurance so that it’s more effective in today’s economy  but first this congress need to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 16 million people let me tell you why misty demars be a mother of two young boys she’d be steadily employ since she be a teenager  she put herself through college  she’d never collect unemployment benefit  in may she and her husband use their life save to buy their first home  a week later budget cut claim the job she love  last month when their unemployment insurance be cut off she sit down and write me a letter – the kind i get every day  “we be the face of the unemployment crisis” she write  “i be not dependent on the government…our country depend on people like us who build career contribute to society…care about our neighbors…i be confident that in time i will find a job…i will pay my tax and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love  please give us this chance” congress give these hardworking responsible americans that chance  they need our help but more important this country need them in the game  that’s why i’ve be ask ceos to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shoot at that new job and new chance to support their families this week many will come to the white house to make that commitment real  tonight i ask every business leader in america to join us and to do the same – because we be stronger when america field a full team  of course it’s not enough to train today’s workforce  we also have to prepare tomorrow’s workforce by guarantee every child access to a world-class education estiven rodriguez couldn’t speak a word of english when he move to new york city at age nine  but last month thank to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutor program he lead a march of his classmates – through a crowd of cheer parent and neighbor – from their high school to the post office where they mail off their college applications  and this son of a factory worker just find out he’s go to college this fall five years ago we set out to change the odds for all our kid  we work with lenders to reform student loan and today more young people be earn college degrees than ever before  race to the top with the help of governors from both party have help state raise expectations and performance  teachers and principals in school from tennessee to washington dc be make big stride in prepare students with skills for the new economy – problem solve critical think science technology engineer and math  some of this change be hard  it require everything from more challenge curriculums and more demand parent to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kid think not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test  but it’s worth it – and it’s work  the problem be we’re still not reach enough kid and we’re not reach them in time  that have to change  research show that one of the best investments we can make in a child’s life be high-quality early education  last year i ask this congress to help state make high-quality pre-k available to every four year-old  as a parent as well as a president i repeat that request tonight but in the meantime thirty state have raise pre-k fund on their own  they know we can’t wait  so just as we work with state to reform our school this year we’ll invest in new partnerships with state and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children  and as congress decide what it’s go to do i’m go to pull together a coalition of elect officials business leaders and philanthropists will to help more kid access the high-quality pre-k they need last year i also pledge to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years  tonight i can announce that with the support of the fcc and company like apple microsoft sprint and verizon we’ve get a down payment to start connect more than 15000 school and twenty million students over the next two years without add a dime to the deficit  we’re work to redesign high school and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on train that can lead directly to a job and career  we’re shake up our system of higher education to give parent more information and colleges more incentives to offer better value so that no middle-class kid be price out of a college education  we’re offer millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income and i want to work with congress to see how we can help even more americans who feel trap by student loan debt  and i’m reach out to some of america’s lead foundations and corporations on a new initiativeto help more young men of color face tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential the bottom line be michelle and i want every child to have the same chance this country give us  but we know our opportunity agenda won’t be complete – and too many young people enter the workforce today will see the american dream as an empty promise – unless we do more to make sure our economy honor the dignity of work and hard work pay off for every single american  today women make up about half our workforce  but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earn  that be wrong and in 2014 it’s an embarrassment a woman deserve equal pay for equal work  she deserve to have a baby without sacrifice her job  a mother deserve a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without run into hardship – and you know what a father do too  it’s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a “mad men” episode  this year let’s all come together – congress the white house and businesses from wall street to main street – to give every woman the opportunity she deserve  because i firmly believe when women succeed america succeed now women hold a majority of lower-wage job – but they’re not the only ones stifle by stagnant wag  americans understand that some people will earn more than others and we don’t resent those who by virtue of their efforts achieve incredible success  but americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who work full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty in the year since i ask this congress to raise the minimum wage five state have pass laws to raise theirs  many businesses have do it on their own  nick chute be here tonight with his boss john soranno  john’s an owner of punch pizza in minneapolis and nick help make the dough  only now he make more of it john just give his employees a raise to ten buck an hour – a decision that ease their financial stress and boost their morale tonight i ask more of america’s business leaders to follow john’s lead and do what you can to raise your employees’ wag  to every mayor governor and state legislator in america i say you don’t have to wait for congress to act americans will support you if you take this on  and as a chief executive i intend to lead by example profitable corporations like costco see higher wag as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover we should too  in the come weeks i will issue an executive order require federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $1010 an hour – because if you cook our troops’ meals or wash their dish you shouldn’t have to live in poverty of course to reach millions more congress need to get on board today the federal minimum wage be worth about twenty percent less than it be when ronald reagan first stand here  tom harkin and george miller have a bill to fix that by lift the minimum wage to $1010  this will help families  it will give businesses customers with more money to spend  it doesn’t involve any new bureaucratic program  so join the rest of the country  say yes  give america a raise there be other step we can take to help families make end meet and few be more effective at reduce inequality and help families pull themselves up through hard work than the earn income tax credit  right now it help about half of all parent at some point  but i agree with republicans like senator rubio that it doesn’t do enough for single workers who don’t have kid  so let’s work together to strengthen the credit reward work and help more americans get ahead let’s do more to help americans save for retirement today most workers don’t have a pension  a social security check often isn’t enough on its own  and while the stock market have double over the last five years that doesn’t help folks who don’t have 401ks  that’s why tomorrow i will direct the treasury to create a new way for work americans to start their own retirement save myra it’s a new save bond that encourage folks to build a nest egg  myra guarantee a decent return with no risk of lose what you put in  and if this congress want to help work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that give big tax break to help the wealthy save but do little to nothing for middle-class americans  offer every american access to an automatic ira on the job so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can  and since the most important investment many families make be their home send me legislation that protect taxpayers from foot the bill for a house crisis ever again and keep the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of americans one last point on financial security  for decades few things expose hard-working families to economic hardship more than a break health care system  and in case you haven’t hear we’re in the process of fix that a pre-existing condition use to mean that someone like amanda shelley a physician assistant and single mom from arizona couldn’t get health insurance  but on january 1st she get cover  on january 3rd she felt a sharp pain  on january 6th she have emergency surgery  just one week earlier amanda say that surgery would’ve mean bankruptcy that’s what health insurance reform be all about – the peace of mind that if misfortune strike you don’t have to lose everything  already because of the affordable care act more than three million americans under age 26 have gain coverage under their parents’ plan more than nine million americans have sign up for private health insurance or medicaid coverage and here’s another number zero  because of this law no american can ever again be drop or deny coverage for a preexist condition like asthma back pain or cancer no woman can ever be charge more just because she’s a woman  and we do all this while add years to medicare’s finance keep medicare premiums flat and lower prescription cost for millions of seniors now i don’t expect to convince my republican friends on the merit of this law  but i know that the american people aren’t interest in refighting old battle  so again if you have specific plan to cut cost cover more people and increase choice – tell america what you’d do differently  let’s see if the number add up  but let’s not have another forty-something vote to repeal a law that’s already help millions of americans like amanda  the first forty be plenty  we get it  we all owe it to the american people to say what we’re for not just what we’re against  and if you want to know the real impact this law be have just talk to governor steve beshear of kentucky who’s here tonight  kentucky’s not the most liberal part of the country but he’s like a man possess when it come to cover his commonwealth’s families  “they be our friends and neighbors” he say  “they be people we shop and go to church with…farmers out on the tractors…grocery clerks…they be people who go to work every morning pray they don’t get sick  no one deserve to live that way”  steve’s right  that’s why tonight i ask every american who know someone without health insurance to help them get cover by march 31st  moms get on your kid to sign up  kid call your mom and walk her through the application  it will give her some peace of mind – plus she’ll appreciate hear from you  after all that’s the spirit that have always move this nation forward  it’s the spirit of citizenship – the recognition that through hard work and responsibility we can pursue our individual dream but still come together as one american family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dream as well citizenship mean stand up for everyone’s right to vote  last year part of the vote right act be weaken  but conservative republicans and liberal democrats be work together to strengthen it and the bipartisan commission i appoint last year have offer reform so that no one have to wait more than a half hour to vote  let’s support these efforts  it should be the power of our vote not the size of our bank account that drive our democracy citizenship mean stand up for the live that gun violence steal from us each day  i have see the courage of parent students pastors and police officer all over this country who say “we be not afraid” and i intend to keep try with or without congress to help stop more tragedies from visit innocent americans in our movie theaters shop malls or school like sandy hook citizenship demand a sense of common cause participation in the hard work of self-government an obligation to serve to our communities  and i know this chamber agree that few americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the unite state arm force tonight because of the extraordinary troop and civilians who risk and lay down their live to keep us free the unite state be more secure  when i take office nearly 180000 americans be serve in iraq and afghanistan  today all our troop be out of iraq  more than 60000 of our troop have already come home from afghanistan  with afghan force now in the lead for their own security our troop have move to a support role together with our ally we will complete our mission there by the end of this year and america’s longest war will finally be over after 2014 we will support a unify afghanistan as it take responsibility for its own future  if the afghan government sign a security agreement that we have negotiate a small force of americans could remain in afghanistan with nato ally to carry out two narrow missions train and assist afghan force and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al qaeda  for while our relationship with afghanistan will change one thing will not our resolve that terrorists do not launch attack against our country the fact be that danger remain  while we have put al qaeda’s core leadership on a path to defeat the threat have evolve as al qaeda affiliate and other extremists take root in different part of the world in yemen somalia iraq and mali we have to keep work with partner to disrupt and disable these network in syria we’ll support the opposition that reject  the agenda of terrorist network here at home we’ll keep strengthen our defenses and combat new threats like cyberattacks  and as we reform our defense budget we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions we have to remain vigilant  but i strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone as commander-in-chief i have use force when need to protect the american people and i will never hesitate to do so as long as i hold this office  but i will not send our troop into harm’s way unless it’s truly necessary nor will i allow our sons and daughters to be mire in open-ended conflict  we must fight the battle that need to be fight not those that terrorists prefer from us – large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately fee extremism so even as we aggressively pursue terrorist network – through more target efforts and by build the capacity of our foreign partner – america must move off a permanent war foot  that’s why i’ve impose prudent limit on the use of drone – for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence  that’s why work with this congress i will reform our surveillance program – because the vital work of our intelligence community depend on public confidence here and abroad that the privacy of ordinary people be not be violate  and with the afghan war end this need to be the year congress lift the remain restrictions on detainee transfer and we close the prison at guantanamo bay – because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action but by remain true to our constitutional ideals and set an example for the rest of the world you see in a world of complex threats our security and leadership depend on all elements of our power – include strong and principled diplomacy  american diplomacy have rally more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from fall into the wrong hand and allow us to reduce our own reliance on cold war stockpile  american diplomacy back by the threat of force be why syria’s chemical weapons be be eliminate and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the syrian people deserve – a future free of dictatorship terror and fear as we speak american diplomacy be support israelis and palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talk to end the conflict there to achieve dignity and an independent state for palestinians and last peace and security for the state of israel – a jewish state that know america will always be at their side and it be american diplomacy back by pressure that have halt the progress of iran’s nuclear program – and roll part of that program back – for the very first time in a decade  as we gather here tonight iran have begin to eliminate its stockpile of higher level of enrich uranium  it be not instal advance centrifuge  unprecedented inspections help the world verify every day that iran be not build a bomb  and with our ally and partner we’re engage in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share prevent iran from obtain a nuclear weapon these negotiations will be difficult  they may not succeed  we be clear-eyed about iran’s support for terrorist organizations like hezbollah which threaten our ally and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wish away  but these negotiations do not rely on trust any long-term deal we agree to must be base on verifiable action that convince us and the international community that iran be not build a nuclear bomb  if john f kennedy and ronald reagan could negotiate with the soviet union then surely a strong and confident america can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today the sanction that we put in place help make this opportunity possible  but let me be clear if this congress send me a new sanction bill now that threaten to derail these talk i will veto it  for the sake of our national security we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed  if iran’s leaders do not seize this opportunity then i will be the first to call for more sanction and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure iran do not build a nuclear weapon  but if iran’s leaders do seize the chance then iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations and we will have resolve one of the lead security challenge of our time without the risk of war finally let’s remember that our leadership be define not just by our defense against threats but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understand around the globe – to forge greater cooperation to expand new market to free people from fear and want  and no one be better position to take advantage of those opportunities than america  our alliance with europe remain the strongest the world have ever know  from tunisia to burma we’re support those who be will to do the hard work of build democracy  in ukraine we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully and have a say in their country’s future  across africa we’re bring together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty  in the americas we be build new tie of commerce but we’re also expand cultural and educational exchange among young people  and we will continue to focus on the asia-pacific where we support our ally shape a future of greater security and prosperity and extend a hand to those devastate by disaster – as we do in the philippines when our marines and civilians rush to aid those batter by a typhoon and be greet with word like “we will never forget your kindness” and “god bless america” we do these things because they help promote our long-term security  and we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human be regardless of race or religion creed or sexual orientation  and next week the world will see one expression of that commitment – when team usa march the red white and blue into the olympic stadium – and bring home the gold my fellow americans no other country in the world do what we do  on every issue the world turn to us not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might – but because of the ideals we stand for and the burden we bear to advance them no one know this better than those who serve in uniform  as this time of war draw to a close a new generation of heroes return to civilian life  we’ll keep slash that backlog so our veterans receive the benefit they’ve earn and our wound warriors receive the health care – include the mental health care – that they need  we’ll keep work to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into job here at home  and we all continue to join force to honor and support our remarkable military families let me tell you about one of those families i’ve come to know i first meet cory remsburg a proud army ranger at omaha beach on the 65th anniversary of d-day  along with some of his fellow rangers he walk me through the program – a strong impressive young man with an easy manner sharp as a tack  we joke around and take picture and i tell him to stay in touch a few months later on his tenth deployment cory be nearly kill by a massive roadside bomb in afghanistan his comrades find him in a canal face down underwater shrapnel in his brain  for months he lay in a coma  the next time i meet him in the hospital he couldn’t speak he could barely move  over the years he’s endure dozens of surgeries and procedures and hours of grueling rehab every day  even now cory be still blind in one eye  he still struggle on his leave side  but slowly steadily with the support of caregivers like his dad craig and the community around him cory have grow stronger day by day he’s learn to speak again and stand again and walk again – and he’s work toward the day when he can serve his country again  “my recovery have not be easy” he say “nothing in life that’s worth anything be easy”  cory be here tonight  and like the army he love like the america he serve sergeant first class cory remsburg never give up and he do not quit  my fellow americans men and women like cory remind us that america have never come easy  our freedom our democracy have never be easy  sometimes we stumble we make mistake we get frustrate or discourage  but for more than two hundred years we have put those things aside and place our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress – to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement to free other nations from tyranny and fear to promote justice and fairness and equality under the law so that the word set to paper by our founder be make real for every citizen  the america we want for our kid – a rise america where honest work be plentiful and communities be strong where prosperity be widely share and opportunity for all let us go as far as our dream and toil will take us – none of it be easy  but if we work together if we summon what be best in us with our feet plant firmly in today but our eye cast towards tomorrow – i know it’s within our reach  believe it god bless you and god bless the unite state of america  '"
