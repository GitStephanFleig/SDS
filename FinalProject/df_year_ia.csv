Donald Trump,"January 20, 2017","
      
      Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.

We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.

Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.

We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.

Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.

Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People.

For too long, a small group in our nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.

Washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth.

Politicians prospered – but the jobs left, and the factories closed.

The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.

Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.

That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.

It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. 

This is your day. This is your celebration.

And this, the United States of America, is your country.

What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.

January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. 

The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.

Everyone is listening to you now.

You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.

At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.

Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.

These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.

But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.

This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.

We are one nation – and their pain is our pain.  Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success.  We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.

The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.

For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;

Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;

We've defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own;

And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.

We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.

One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind.

The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.

But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.

We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.

From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.

From this moment on, it’s going to be America First.

Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.

We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.

I will fight for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you down.

America will start winning again, winning like never before.

We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders.  We will bring back our wealth.  And we will bring back our dreams.

We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.

We will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.

We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.

We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.

We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.

We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.

At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.

When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.

The Bible tells us, “how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.”

We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.

When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.

There should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always be protected.

We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God.

Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.

In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.

We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.

The time for empty talk is over.

Now arrives the hour of action.

Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done.  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.

We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.

We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.

A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.

It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.

And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.

So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:

You will never be ignored again.

Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.

Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.

We Will Make America Wealthy Again.

We Will Make America Proud Again.

We Will Make America Safe Again.

And, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless America.

the citizens of america, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people.', 'together, we will determine the course of america and the world for years to come.', 'we will face challenges.', 'we will confront hardships.', 'but we will get the job done.', 'every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to president obama and first lady michelle obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.', 'they have been magnificent.', 'today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning.', 'because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are transferring power from washington, d.c. and giving it back to you, the american people.', 'for too long, a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.', 'washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth.', 'politicians prospered – but the jobs left, and the factories closed.', 'the establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.', 'their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.', 'that all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.', 'it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across america.', 'this is your day.', 'this is your celebration.', 'and this, the united states of america, is your country.', 'what truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.', 'january 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.', 'the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.', 'everyone is listening to you now.', 'you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.', 'at the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.', 'americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.', 'these are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.', 'but for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.', 'this american carnage stops right here and stops right now.', 'we are one nation – and their pain is our pain.', 'their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success.', 'we share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.', 'the oath of office i take today is an oath of allegiance to all americans.', ""for many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of american industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military; we've defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own; and spent trillions of dollars overseas while america's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay."", 'we’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.', 'one by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of american workers left behind.', 'the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world.', 'but that is the past.', 'and now we are looking only to the future.', 'we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.', 'from this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.', 'from this moment on, it’s going to be america first.', 'every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit american workers and american families.', 'we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.', 'protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.', 'i will fight for you with every breath in my body – and i will never, ever let you down.', 'america will start winning again, winning like never before.', 'we will bring back our jobs.', 'we will bring back our borders.', 'we will bring back our wealth.', 'and we will bring back our dreams.', 'we will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation.', 'we will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with american hands and american labor.', 'we will follow two simple rules: buy american and hire american.', 'we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.', 'we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.', 'we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against radical islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.', 'at the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the united states of america, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.', 'when you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.', 'the bible tells us, “how good and pleasant it is when god’s people live together in unity.” we must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.', 'when america is united, america is totally unstoppable.', 'there should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always be protected.', 'we will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by god.', 'finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.', 'in america, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.', 'we will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.', 'the time for empty talk is over.', 'now arrives the hour of action.', 'do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done.', 'no challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of america.', 'we will not fail.', 'our country will thrive and prosper again.', 'we stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.', 'a new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.', 'it is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great american flag.', 'and whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of detroit or the windswept plains of nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.', 'so to all americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words: you will never be ignored again.', 'your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our american destiny.', 'and your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.', 'together, we will make america strong again.', 'we will make america wealthy again.', 'we will make america proud again.', 'we will make america safe again.', 'and, yes, together, we will make america great again.', 'thank you, god bless you, and god bless america.']","['chief', 'justice', 'roberts', 'carter', 'clinton', 'bush', 'obama', 'fellow', 'americans', 'people', 'world', 'thank',

Each time we gather to inaugurate a President we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution.  We affirm the promise of our democracy.  We recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names.  What makes us exceptional -- what makes us American -- is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago:
“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”  
 
Today we continue a never-ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time.  For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they’ve never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth.  (Applause.)  The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob.  They gave to us a republic, a government of, and by, and for the people, entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed.  
 
And for more than two hundred years, we have.  
 
Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half-slave and half-free.  We made ourselves anew, and vowed to move forward together.  
 
Together, we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce, schools and colleges to train our workers. 
 
Together, we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play.  
 
Together, we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable, and protect its people from life’s worst hazards and misfortune. 
 
Through it all, we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority, nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society’s ills can be cured through government alone.  Our celebration of initiative and enterprise, our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility, these are constants in our character.
 
But we have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.  For the American people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias.  No single person can train all the math and science teachers we’ll need to equip our children for the future, or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores.  Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation and one people.  (Applause.) 
 
This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience.  A decade of war is now ending.  (Applause.)  An economic recovery has begun.  (Applause.)  America’s possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands:  youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention.  My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it -- so long as we seize it together.  (Applause.)  
 
For we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.  (Applause.)  We believe that America’s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class.  We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship.  We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American; she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own.  (Applause.)   
 
We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time.  So we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our tax code, reform our schools, and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder, learn more, reach higher.  But while the means will change, our purpose endures:  a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American.  That is what this moment requires.  That is what will give real meaning to our creed.   
 
We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity.  We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit.  But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future.  (Applause.)  For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn. 
 
We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few.  We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us at any time may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home swept away in a terrible storm.  The commitments we make to each other through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security, these things do not sap our initiative, they strengthen us.  (Applause.)  They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.  (Applause.)  
 
We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity.  We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.  (Applause.)  Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.  
 
The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult.  But America cannot resist this transition, we must lead it.  We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries, we must claim its promise.  That’s how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure -- our forests and waterways, our crop lands and snow-capped peaks.  That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God.  That’s what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared.
 
We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war.  (Applause.)  Our brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are unmatched in skill and courage.  (Applause.)  Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have lost, know too well the price that is paid for liberty.  The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm. But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war; who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends -- and we must carry those lessons into this time as well.
 
We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law.  We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully –- not because we are naïve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear.  (Applause.)
 
America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe.  And we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation.  We will support democracy from Asia to Africa, from the Americas to the Middle East, because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom.  And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice –- not out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes:  tolerance and opportunity, human dignity and justice.  
 
We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths –- that all of us are created equal –- is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall, to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.  (Applause.) 
 
It is now our generation’s task to carry on what those pioneers began.  For our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts.  (Applause.)  Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law  –- (applause) -- for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.  (Applause.)  Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.  (Applause.)  Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity -- (applause) -- until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country.  (Applause.)   Our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia, to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm.  
 
That is our generation’s task -- to make these words, these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American.  Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life. It does not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way or follow the same precise path to happiness.  Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time, but it does require us to act in our time.  (Applause.)  
 
For now decisions are upon us and we cannot afford delay.  We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.  (Applause.)  We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect.  We must act, knowing that today’s victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall. 
 
My fellow Americans, the oath I have sworn before you today, like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol, was an oath to God and country, not party or faction.  And we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service.  But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream.  My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride.  
 
They are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope.  You and I, as citizens, have the power to set this country’s course.  You and I, as citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our time -- not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.  (Applause.)  
 
Let us, each of us, now embrace with solemn duty and awesome joy what is our lasting birthright.  With common effort and common purpose, with passion and dedication, let us answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom.  
 
Thank you.  God bless you, and may He forever bless these United States of America.  (Applause.)

(applause.)  we must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect.  we must act, knowing that today’s victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years and 40 years and 400 years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare philadelphia hall.   my fellow americans, the oath i have sworn before you today, like the one recited by others who serve in this capitol, was an oath to god and country, not party or faction.  and we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service.  but the words i spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty or an immigrant realizes her dream.  my oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride.    they are the words of citizens and they represent our greatest hope.  you and i, as citizens, have the power to set this country’s course.  you and i, as citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our time -- not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.  (applause.)    let us, each of us, now embrace with solemn duty and awesome joy what is our lasting birthright.  with common effort and common purpose, with passion and dedication, let us answer the call of history and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom.    thank you.  god bless you, and may he forever bless these united states of america.

congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:    each time we gather to inaugurate a president we bear witness to the enduring strength of our constitution.', 'we affirm the promise of our democracy.', 'we recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names.', 'what makes us exceptional -- what makes us american -- is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago:  “we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”    today we continue a never-ending journey to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time.', 'for history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they’ve never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from god, it must be secured by his people here on earth.', '(applause.)', 'the patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob.', 'they gave to us a republic, a government of, and by, and for the people, entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed.', 'and for more than two hundred years, we have.', 'through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half-slave and half-free.', 'we made ourselves anew, and vowed to move forward together.', 'together, we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce, schools and colleges to train our workers.', 'together, we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play.', 'together, we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable, and protect its people from life’s worst hazards and misfortune.', 'through it all, we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority, nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society’s ills can be cured through government alone.', 'our celebration of initiative and enterprise, our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility, these are constants in our character.', 'but we have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action.', 'for the american people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than american soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias.', 'no single person can train all the math and science teachers we’ll need to equip our children for the future, or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores.', 'now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation and one people.', '(applause.)', 'this generation of americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience.', 'a decade of war is now ending.', '(applause.)', 'an economic recovery has begun.', '(applause.)', 'america’s possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands:  youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention.', 'my fellow americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it -- so long as we seize it together.', '(applause.)', 'for we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.', '(applause.)', 'we believe that america’s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class.', 'we know that america thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship.', 'we are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an american; she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of god but also in our own.', '(applause.)', 'we understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time.', 'so we must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our tax code, reform our schools, and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder, learn more, reach higher.', 'but while the means will change, our purpose endures:  a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single american.', 'that is what this moment requires.', 'that is what will give real meaning to our creed.', 'we, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity.', 'we must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of

Barack Obama,"January 20, 2009","
      
      I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.
Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents.
So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.
That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.
These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land—a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights.
Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America—they will be met.
On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.
On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.
We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.
In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted—for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things—some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.
For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.
For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.
Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.
This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions—that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.
For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act—not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. And all this we will do.
Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions—who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.
What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works—whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.
Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control—and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart—not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.
As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more.
Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.
We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort—even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.
For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.
To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.
To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.
As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us today, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment—a moment that will define a generation—it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.
For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.
Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends—hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism—these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility—a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.
This is the price and the promise of citizenship.
This is the source of our confidence—the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.
This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed—why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.
So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people:
""Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it].""
America. In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations.
Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.

    ",Inaugural Address,Democrat,0,2009,"    I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have bestowed, mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition.  Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents.  So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.  That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.  These are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics. Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land—a nagging fear that America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights.  Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America—they will be met.  On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.  On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.  We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.  In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted—for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things—some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.  For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.  For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.  For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and Khe Sahn.  Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.  This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions—that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.  For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act—not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. And all this we will do.  Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions—who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.  What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works—whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government.  Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control—and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart—not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.  As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals. Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more.  Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.  We are the keepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort—even greater cooperation and understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet. We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.  For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness. We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non-believers. We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.  To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.  To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it.  As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains. They have something to tell us today, just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment—a moment that will define a generation—it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all.  For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate.  Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends—hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism—these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility—a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.  This is the price and the promise of citizenship.  This is the source of our confidence—the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny.  This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed—why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.  So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are and how far we have traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was abandoned. The enemy was advancing.

generation—it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all  for as much as government can do and must do it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours it is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parent's willingness to nurture a child that finally decides our fate  our challenges may be new the instruments with which we meet them may be new but those values upon which our success depends—hard work and honesty courage and fair play tolerance and curiosity loyalty and patriotism—these things are old these things are true they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history what is demanded then is a return to these truths what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility—a recognition on the part of every american that we have duties to ourselves our nation and the world duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task  this is the price and the promise of citizenship  this is the source of our confidence—the knowledge that god calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny  this is the meaning of our liberty and our creed—why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath  so let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled in the year of america's birth in the coldest of months a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river the capital was abandoned the enemy was advancing the snow was stained with blood at a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people  ""let it be told to the future worldthat in the depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survivethat the city and the country alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet [it]""  america in the face of our common dangers in this winter of our hardship let us remember these timeless words with hope and virtue let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come let it be said by our children's children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end that we did not turn back nor did we falter and with eyes fixed on the horizon and god's grace upon us we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations  thank you god bless you and may god bless the united states of america  ","    i stand here today humbled by the task before us grateful for the trust you have bestowed mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors i thank president bush for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition  forty-four americans have now taken the presidential oath the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace yet every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms at these moments america has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers and true to our founding documents  so it has been so it must be with this generation of americans  that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age homes have been lost jobs shed businesses shuttered our health care is too costly our schools fail too many and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet  these are the indicators of crisis subject to data and statistics less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land—a nagging fear that america decline is inevitable and that the next generation must lower its sights  today i say to you that the challenges we face are real they are serious and they are many they will not be met easily or in a short span of time but know this america—they will be met  on this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear unity of purpose over conflict and discord  on this day we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises the recriminations and worn out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics  we remain a young nation but in the words of scripture the time has come to set aside childish things the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit to choose our better history to carry forward that precious gift that noble idea passed on from generation to generation the god-given promise that all are equal all are free and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness  in reaffirming the greatness of our nation we understand that greatness is never a given it must be earned our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less it has not been the path for the faint-hearted—for those who prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame rather it has been the risk-takers the doers the makers of things—some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor who have carried us up the long rugged path towards prosperity and freedom  for us they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life  for us they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth  for us they fought and died in places like concord and gettysburg normandy and khe sahn  time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction  this is the journey we continue today we remain the most prosperous powerful nation on earth our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began our minds are no less inventive our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year our capacity remains undiminished but our time of standing pat of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions—that time has surely passed starting today we must pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking america  for everywhere we look there is work to be done the state of the economy calls for action bold and swift and we will act—not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth we will build the roads and bridges the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together we will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology wonders to raise health care quality and lower its cost we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age all this we can do and all this we will do  now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions—who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans their memories are short for they have forgotten what this country has already done what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage  what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small but whether it works—whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage care they can afford a retirement that is dignified where the answer is yes we intend to move forward where the answer is no programs will end and those of us who manage the public dollars will be held to account—to spend wisely reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government  nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye the market can spin out of control—and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous the success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product but on the reach of our prosperity on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart—not out of charity but because it is the surest route to our common good  as for our common defense we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals our founding fathers faced with perils we can scarcely imagine drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man a charter expanded by the blood of generations those ideals still light the world and we will not give them up for expedience sake and so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born know that america is a friend of each nation and every man woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity and that we are ready to lead once more  recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions they understood that our power alone cannot protect us nor does it entitle us to do as we please instead they knew that our power grows through its prudent use our security emanates from the justness of our cause the force of our example the tempering qualities of humility and restraint  we are the keepers of this legacy guided by these principles once more we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort—even greater cooperation and understanding between nations we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people and forge a hard-earned peace in afghanistan with old friends and former foes we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet we will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken you cannot outlast us and we will defeat you  for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength not a weakness we are a nation of christians and muslims jews and hindus and non-believers we are shaped by every language and culture drawn from every end of this earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grows smaller our common humanity shall reveal itself and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace  to the muslim world we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society ills on the west know that your people will judge you on what you can build not what you destroy to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent know that you are on the wrong side of history but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist  to the people of poor nations we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders nor can we consume the world resources without regard to effect for the world has changed and we must change with it  as we consider the road that unfolds before us we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who at this very hour patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains they have something to tell us today just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages we honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves and yet at this moment—a moment that will define a

transition.', 'forty-four americans have now taken the presidential oath.', 'the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace.', 'yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms.', 'at these moments, america has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents.', 'so it has been.', 'so it must be with this generation of americans.', 'that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood.', 'our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.', 'our economy is badly weakened, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.', 'homes have been lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered.', 'our health care is too costly; our schools fail too many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet.', 'these are the indicators of crisis, subject to data and statistics.',

say to you that the challenges we face are real.', 'they are serious and they are many.', 'they will not be met easily or in a short span of time.', 'but know this, america—they will be met.', 'on this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.', 'on this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.', 'we remain a young nation, but in the words of scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things.', 'the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the god-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.', 'in reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given.', 'it must be earned.', 'our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less.', 'it has not been the path for the faint-hearted—for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame.', 'rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things—some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.', 'for us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life.', 'for us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth.', 'for us, they fought and died, in places like concord and gettysburg; normandy and khe sahn.', 'time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life.', 'they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.', 'this is the journey we continue today.', 'we remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on earth.', 'our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began.', 'our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year.', 'our capacity remains undiminished.', 'but our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions—that time has surely passed.', 'starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking america.', 'for everywhere we look, there is work to be done.', 'the state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act—not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth.', 'we will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together.', ""we will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost."", 'we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories.', 'and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age.', 'all this we can do.', 'and all this we will do.', 'now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions—who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans.', 'their memories are short.', 'for they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.', 'what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them—that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply.', 'the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works—whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.', 'where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward.', 'where the answer is no, programs will end.', ""and those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account—to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day—because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government."", 'nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control—and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous.', 'the success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product, but on the reach of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart—not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.', 'as for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.', 'our founding fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations.', ""those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake."", 'and so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that america is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more.', 'recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.', 'they understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.', 'instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.', 'we are the keepers of this legacy.', 'guided by these principles once more, we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort—even greater cooperation and understanding between nations.', 'we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in afghanistan.', 'with old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming planet.', 'we will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.', 'for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness.', 'we are a nation of christians and muslims, jews and hindus and non-believers.', 'we are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace.', 'to the muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.', ""to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the west, know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy."", 'to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.', 'to the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds.', ""and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect."", 'for the world has changed, and we must change with it.', 'as we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts and distant mountains.', 'they have something to tell us today, just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages.', 'we honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty, but

George W. Bush,"January 20, 2005","
      
      Vice President Cheney, Mr. Chief Justice, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, reverend clergy, distinguished guests, fellow citizens:

On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our Constitution, and recall the deep commitments that unite our country. I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed.

At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the history we have seen together. For a half century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders. After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical - and then there came a day of fire.

We have seen our vulnerability - and we have seen its deepest source. For as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny - prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder - violence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and cross the most defended borders, and raise a mortal threat. There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom.

We are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.

America's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one. From the day of our Founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the Maker of Heaven and earth. Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master, and no one deserves to be a slave. Advancing these ideals is the mission that created our Nation. It is the honorable achievement of our fathers. Now it is the urgent requirement of our nation's security, and the calling of our time.

So it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.

This is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary. Freedom, by its nature, must be chosen, and defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities. And when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own. America will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling. Our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way.

The great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations. The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it. America's influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed, America's influence is considerable, and we will use it confidently in freedom's cause.

My most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people against further attacks and emerging threats. Some have unwisely chosen to test America's resolve, and have found it firm.

We will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation: The moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right. America will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies.

We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people. America's belief in human dignity will guide our policies, yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators; they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed. In the long run, there is no justice without freedom, and there can be no human rights without human liberty.

Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty - though this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt. Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals. Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul. We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery. Liberty will come to those who love it.

Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world:

All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: the United States will not ignore your oppression, or excuse your oppressors. When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you.

Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for who you are: the future leaders of your free country.

The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: ""Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.""

The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: To serve your people you must learn to trust them. Start on this journey of progress and justice, and America will walk at your side.

And all the allies of the United States can know: we honor your friendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on your help. Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom's enemies. The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies' defeat.

Today, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens:

From all of you, I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you have granted in good measure. Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill, and would be dishonorable to abandon. Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom. And as hope kindles hope, millions more will find it. By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well - a fire in the minds of men. It warms those who feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress, and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.

A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause - in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy ... the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments ... the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies. Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives - and we will always honor their names and their sacrifice.

All Americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first time. I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes. You have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers. You have seen that life is fragile, and evil is real, and courage triumphs. Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself - and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country, but to its character.

America has need of idealism and courage, because we have essential work at home - the unfinished work of American freedom. In a world moving toward liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty.

In America's ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence, instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence. This is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act, the Social Security Act, and the G.I. Bill of Rights. And now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time. To give every American a stake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools, and build an ownership society. We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement savings and health insurance - preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society. By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our society more prosperous and just and equal.

In America's ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character - on integrity, and tolerance toward others, and the rule of conscience in our own lives. Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self. That edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran, and the varied faiths of our people. Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before - ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever.

In America's ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service, and mercy, and a heart for the weak. Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another. Our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love. Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another, and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth. And our country must abandon all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time.

From the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many. From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few. Did our generation advance the cause of freedom? And did our character bring credit to that cause?

These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one another in the cause of freedom. We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes - and I will strive in good faith to heal them. Yet those divisions do not define America. We felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart. And we can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good, and the victims of disaster are given hope, and the unjust encounter justice, and the captives are set free.

We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom. Not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is human choices that move events. Not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation; God moves and chooses as He wills. We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul. When our Founders declared a new order of the ages; when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty; when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner ""Freedom Now"" - they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled. History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and the Author of Liberty.

When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, ""It rang as if it meant something."" In our time it means something still. America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world, and to all the inhabitants thereof. Renewed in our strength - tested, but not weary - we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom.

May God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of America.

Some, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty - though this time in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen, is an odd time for doubt. Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of our ideals. Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul. We do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery. Liberty will come to those who love it. Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world: All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: the United States will not ignore your oppression, or excuse your oppressors. When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you. Democratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know: America sees you for who you are: the future leaders of your free country. The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did: ""Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it."" The leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know: To serve your people you must learn to trust them. Start on this journey of progress and justice, and America will walk at your side. And all the allies of the United States can know: we honor your friendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on your help. Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom's enemies. The concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies' defeat. Today, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens: From all of you, I have asked patience in the hard task of securing America, which you have granted in good measure. Our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill, and would be dishonorable to abandon. Yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation, tens of millions have achieved their freedom. And as hope kindles hope, millions more will find it. By our efforts, we have lit a fire as well - a fire in the minds of men. It warms those who feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress, and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world. A few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause - in the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy ... the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments ... the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies. Some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives - and we will always honor their names and their sacrifice. All Americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first time. I ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes. You have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers. You have seen that life is fragile, and evil is real, and courage triumphs. Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants, larger than yourself - and in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country, but to its character. America has need of idealism and courage, because we have essential work at home - the unfinished work of American freedom. In a world moving toward liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty. In America's ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence, instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence. This is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead Act, the Social Security Act, and the G.I. Bill of Rights. And now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time. To give every American a stake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools, and build an ownership society. We will widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement savings and health insurance - preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society. By making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow Americans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our society more prosperous and just and equal. In America's ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character - on integrity, and tolerance toward others, and the rule of conscience in our own lives. Self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self. That edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the Koran, and the varied faiths of our people. Americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before - ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever. In America's ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service, and mercy, and a heart for the weak. Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another. Our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love. Americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another, and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth. And our country must abandon all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time. From the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many. From the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few. Did our generation advance the cause of freedom? And did our character bring credit to that cause? These questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every party and background, Americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one another in the cause of freedom. We have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes - and I will strive in good faith to heal them. Yet those divisions do not define America. We felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart. And we can feel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good, and the victims of disaster are given hope, and the unjust encounter justice, and the captives are set free. We go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom. Not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is human choices that move events. Not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation; God moves and chooses as He wills. We have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul. When our Founders declared a new order of the ages; when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty; when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner ""Freedom Now"" - they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled. History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and the Author of Liberty. When the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the Liberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, ""It rang as if it meant something."" In our time it means something still. America, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world, and to all the inhabitants thereof. Renewed in our strength - tested, but not weary - we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom. May God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of America.  ","    vice president cheney, mr. chief justice, president carter, president bush, president clinton, reverend clergy, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: on this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our constitution, and recall the deep commitments that unite our country. i am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that i have sworn and you have witnessed. at this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words i use, but by the history we have seen together. for a half century, america defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders. after the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical - and then there came a day of fire. we have seen our vulnerability - and we have seen its deepest source. for as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny - prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder - violence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and cross the most defended borders, and raise a mortal threat. there is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom. we are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. the best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world. america's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one. from the day of our founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the maker of heaven and earth. across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master, and no one deserves to be a slave. advancing these ideals is the mission that created our nation. it is the honorable achievement of our fathers. now it is the urgent requirement of our nation's security, and the calling of our time. so it is the policy of the united states to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. this is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary. freedom, by its nature, must be chosen, and defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities. and when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own. america will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling. our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way. the great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations. the difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it. america's influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed, america's influence is considerable, and we will use it confidently in freedom's cause. my most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people against further attacks and emerging threats. some have unwisely chosen to test america's resolve, and have found it firm. we will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation: the moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and freedom, which is eternally right. america will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies. we will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people. america's belief in human dignity will guide our policies, yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators; they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed. in the long run, there is no justice without freedom, and there can be no human rights without human liberty. some, i know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty -

look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love americans at our best value the life we see in one another and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth and our country must abandon all the habits of racism because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time from the perspective of a single day including this day of dedication the issues and questions before our country are many from the viewpoint of centuries the questions that come to us are narrowed and few did our generation advance the cause of freedom and did our character bring credit to that cause these questions that judge us also unite us because americans of every party and background americans by choice and by birth are bound to one another in the cause of freedom we have known divisions which must be healed to move forward in great purposes - and i will strive in good faith to heal them yet those divisions do not define america we felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack and our response came like a single hand over a single heart and we can feel that same unity and pride whenever america acts for good and the victims of disaster are given hope and the unjust encounter justice and the captives are set free we go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability it is human choices that move events not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation god moves and chooses as he wills we have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind the hunger in dark places the longing of the soul when our founders declared a new order of the ages when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner ""freedom now"" - they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled history has an ebb and flow of justice but history also has a visible direction set by liberty and the author of liberty when the declaration of independence was first read in public and the liberty bell was sounded in celebration a witness said ""it rang as if it meant something"" in our time it means something still america in this young century proclaims liberty throughout all the world and to all the inhabitants thereof renewed in our strength - tested but not weary - we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom may god bless you and may he watch over the united states of america  ","    vice president cheney mr chief justice

and institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of end tyranny in our world this be not primarily the task of arm though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arm when necessary freedom by its nature must be choose and defend by citizens and sustain by the rule of law and the protection of minorities and when the soul of a nation finally speak the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own america will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling our goal instead be to help others find their own voice attain their own freedom and make their own way the great objective of end tyranny be the concentrate work of generations the difficulty of the task be no excuse for avoid it america influence be not

be aspire to live at the mercy of bully we will encourage reform in other governments by make clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people america belief in human dignity will guide our policies yet right must be more than the grudge concessions of dictators they be secure by free dissent and the participation of the govern in the long run there be no justice without freedom and there can be no human right without human liberty some i know have question the global appeal of liberty - though this time in history four decades define by the swiftest

guests, fellow citizens: on this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our constitution, and recall the deep commitments that unite our country.', 'i am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the oath that i have sworn and you have witnessed.', 'at this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words i use, but by the history we have seen together.', 'for a half century, america defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders.', 'after the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose, years of sabbatical - and then there came a day of fire.', 'we have seen our vulnerability - and we have seen its deepest source.', 'for as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny - prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder - violence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and cross the most defended borders, and raise a mortal threat.', 'there is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom.', 'we are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion: the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands.', 'the best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.', ""america's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one."", 'from the day of our founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear the image of the maker of heaven and earth.', 'across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit to be a master, and no one deserves to be a slave.', 'advancing these ideals is the mission that created our nation.', 'it is the honorable achievement of our fathers.', ""now it is the urgent requirement of our nation's security, and the calling of our time."", 'so it is the policy of the united states to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.', 'this is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary.', 'freedom, by its nature, must be chosen, and defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities.', 'and when the soul of a nation finally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own.', 'america will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling.', 'our goal instead is to help others find their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way.', 'the great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations.', 'the difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it.', ""america's influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed, america's influence is considerable, and we will use it confidently in freedom's cause."", 'my most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people against further attacks and emerging threats.', ""some have unwisely

and freedom, which is eternally right.', 'america will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliation and servitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies.', 'we will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people.', ""america's belief in human dignity will guide our policies, yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators; they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed."", 'in the long run, there is no justice without freedom, and there can be no human rights without human liberty.', 'some, i know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty - though this time in history, four decades

sacrifice.', 'all americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first time.', 'i ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes.', 'you have seen duty and allegiance in the

american freedom.', 'in a world moving toward liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty.', ""in america's ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence, instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence."", 'this is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the homestead act, the social security act, and the g.i.', 'bill of rights.', 'and now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time.', 'to give every american a stake in the promise and future of our country, we will bring the highest standards to our schools, and build an ownership society.', 'we will widen the ownership of homes and businesses, retirement savings and health insurance - preparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society.', 'by making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow americans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our society more prosperous and just and equal.', ""in america's ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private character - on integrity, and tolerance toward others, and the rule of conscience in our own lives."", 'self-government relies, in the end, on the governing of the self.', 'that edifice of character is built in families, supported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national life by the truths of sinai, the sermon on the mount, the words of the koran, and the varied faiths of our people.', 'americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before - ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday, today, and forever.', ""in america's ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by service, and mercy, and a heart for the weak."", 'liberty for all does not mean independence from one another.', 'our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love.', 'americans, at our best, value the life we see in one another, and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth.', 'and our country must abandon all the habits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time.', 'from the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication, the issues and questions before our country are many.', 'from the viewpoint of centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few.', 'did our generation advance the cause of freedom?', 'and did our character bring credit to that cause?', 'these questions that judge us also unite us, because americans of every party and background, americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one another in the cause of freedom.', 'we have known divisions, which must be healed to move forward in great purposes - and i will strive in good faith to heal them.', 'yet those divisions do not define america.', 'we felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack, and our response came like a single hand over a single heart.', 'and we can feel that same unity and pride whenever america acts for good, and the victims of disaster are given hope, and the unjust encounter justice, and the captives are set free.', 'we go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom.', 'not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is human choices that move events.', 'not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation; god moves and chooses as he wills.', 'we have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark places, the longing of the soul.', 'when our founders declared a new order of the ages; when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty; when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner ""freedom now"" - they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled.', 'history has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction, set by liberty and the author of liberty.', 'when the declaration of independence was first read in public and the liberty bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, ""it rang as if it meant something.""', 'in our time it means something still.', 'america, in this young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world, and to all the inhabitants thereof.',

George W. Bush,"January 20, 2001","
      
      President Clinton, distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, the peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.
As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation.
And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.
I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow.
We have a place, all of us, in a long story—a story we continue, but whose end we will not see. It is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of a slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.
It is the American story—a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals.
The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born.
Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws. And though our nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.
Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations.
Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. And even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel.
While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country.
We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.
I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His image.
And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.
America has never been united by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens. Every child must be taught these principles. Every citizen must uphold them. And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.
Today, we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion and character.
America, at its best, matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility. A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness.
Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, the stakes of our debates appear small.
But the stakes for America are never small. If our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If we permit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.
We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.
America, at its best, is also courageous.
Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defending common dangers defined our common good. Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us. We must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations.
Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives.
We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent. And we will reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans.
We will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge.
We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors.
The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged in the world by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom. We will defend our allies and our interests. We will show purpose without arrogance. We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength. And to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth.
America, at its best, is compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise.
And whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault. Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God, they are failures of love.
And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our souls.
Where there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities. And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.
Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights and common schools. Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government.
And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer. Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws.
Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do.
And I can pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.
America, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected.
Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to conscience. And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment. We find the fullness of life not only in options, but in commitments. And we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free.
Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom.
Sometimes in life we are called to do great things. But as a saint of our times has said, every day we are called to do small things with great love. The most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone.
I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well.
In all these ways, I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times.
What you do is as important as anything government does. I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against easy attacks; to serve your nation, beginning with your neighbor. I ask you to be citizens: citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects; responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character.
Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves, but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves. When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no government program can replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.
After the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia statesman John Page wrote to Thomas Jefferson: ""We know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong. Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?""
Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration. The years and changes accumulate. But the themes of this day he would know: our nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity.
We are not this story's author, who fills time and eternity with his purpose. Yet his purpose is achieved in our duty, and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another.
Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make our country more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life.
This work continues. This story goes on. And an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm.
God bless you all, and God bless America.

    ",Inaugural Address,Republican,1,2001,"    President Clinton, distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, the peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.  As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation.  And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.  I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow.  We have a place, all of us, in a long story—a story we continue, but whose end we will not see. It is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of a slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.  It is the American story—a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals.  The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born.  Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws. And though our nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.  Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations.  Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. And even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel.  While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country.  We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.  I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His image.  And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.  America has never been united by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens. Every child must be taught these principles. Every citizen must uphold them. And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.  Today, we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion and character.  America, at its best, matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility. A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness.  Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, the stakes of our debates appear small.  But the stakes for America are never small. If our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If we permit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.  We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.  America, at its best, is also courageous.  Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defending common dangers defined our common good. Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us. We must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations.  Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives.  We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent. And we will reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans.  We will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge.  We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors.  The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged in the world by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom. We will defend our allies and our interests. We will show purpose without arrogance. We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength. And to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth.  America, at its best, is compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise.  And whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault. Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God, they are failures of love.  And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our souls.  Where there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities. And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.  Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights and common schools. Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government.  And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer. Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws.  Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do.  And I can pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.  America, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected.  Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to conscience. And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment. We find the fullness of life not only in options, but in commitments. And we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free.  Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom.  Sometimes in life we are called to do great things. But as a saint of our times has said, every day we are called to do small things with great love.

will follow  we have a place all of us in a long story—a story we continue but whose end we will not see it be the story of a new world that become a friend and liberator of the old a story of a slave-holding society that become a servant of freedom the story of a power that go into the world to protect but not possess to defend but not to conquer  it be the american story—a story of flaw and fallible people unite across the generations by grand and endure ideals  the grandest of these ideals be an unfold american promise that everyone belong that everyone deserve a chance that no insignificant person be ever bear  americans be call to enact this promise in our live and in our laws and though our nation have sometimes halt and sometimes delay we must follow no other course  through much of the last century america faith in freedom and democracy be a rock in a rag sea now it be a seed upon the wind take root in many nations  our democratic faith be more than the creed of our country it be the inborn hope of our humanity an ideal we carry but do not own a trust we bear and pass along and even after nearly 225 years we have a long way yet to travel  while many of our citizens prosper others doubt the promise even the justice of our own country the ambition of some americans be limit by fail school and hide prejudice and the circumstances of their birth and sometimes our differences run so deep it seem we share a continent but not a country  we do not accept this and we will not allow it our unity our union be the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation and this be my solemn pledge i will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity  i know this be in our reach because we be guide by a power larger than ourselves who create us equal in his image  and we be confident in principles that unite and lead us onward  america have never be unite by blood or birth or soil we be bind by ideals that move us beyond our background lift us above our interest and teach us what it mean to be citizens every child must be teach these principles every citizen must uphold them and every immigrant by embrace these ideals make our country more not less american  today we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation promise through civility courage compassion and character  america at its best match a commitment to principle with a concern for civility a civil society demand from each of us good will and respect fair deal and forgiveness  some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because in a time of peace the stake of our debate appear small  but the stake for america be never small if our country do not lead the cause of freedom it will not be lead if we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character we will lose their gift and undermine their idealism if we permit our economy to drift and decline the vulnerable will suffer most  we must live up to the call we share civility be not a tactic or a sentiment it be the determine choice of trust over cynicism of community over chaos and this commitment if we keep it be a way to share accomplishment  america at its best be also courageous  our national courage have be clear in time of depression and war when defend common dangers define our common good now we must choose if the example of our father and mother will inspire us or condemn us we must show courage in a time of bless by confront problems instead of pass them on to future generations  together we will reclaim america school before ignorance and apathy claim more young live  we will reform social security and medicare spar our children from struggle we have the power to prevent and we will reduce tax to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of work americans  we will build our defenses beyond challenge lest weakness invite challenge  we will confront weapons of mass destruction so that a new century be spar new horrors  the enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake america remain engage in the world by history and by choice shape a balance of power that favor freedom we will defend our ally and our interest we will show purpose without arrogance we will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength and to all nations we will speak for the value that give our nation birth  america at its best be compassionate in the quiet of american conscience we know that deep persistent poverty be unworthy of our nation promise  and whatever our view of its cause we can agree that children at risk be not at fault abandonment and abuse be not act of god they be failures of love  and the proliferation of prisons however necessary be no substitute for hope and order in our souls  where there be suffer there be duty americans in need be not strangers they be citizens not problems but priorities and all of us be diminish when any be hopeless  government have great responsibilities for public safety and public health for civil right and common school yet compassion be the work of a nation not just a government  and some need and hurt be so deep they will only respond to a mentor touch or a pastor prayer church and charity synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity and they will have an honor place in our plan and in our laws  many in our country do not know the pain of poverty but we can listen to those who do  and i can pledge our nation to a goal when we see that wound traveler on the road to jericho we will not pass to the other side  america at its best be a place where personal responsibility be value and expect  encourage responsibility be not a search for scapegoats it be a call to conscience and though it require sacrifice it bring a deeper fulfillment we find the fullness of life not only in options but in commitments and we find that children and community be the commitments that set us free  our public interest depend on private character on civic duty and family bond and basic fairness on uncounted unhonored act of decency which give direction to our freedom  sometimes in life we be call to do great things but as a saint of our time have say every day we be call to do small things with great love the most important task of a democracy be do by everyone  i will live and lead by these principles to advance my convictions with civility to pursue the public interest with courage to speak for greater justice and compassion to call for responsibility and try to live it as well  in all these ways i will bring the value of our history to the care of our time  what you do be as important as anything government do i ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort to defend need reform against easy attack to serve your nation begin with your neighbor i ask you to be citizens citizens not spectators citizens not subject responsible citizens build communities of service and a nation of character  americans be generous and strong and decent not because we believe in ourselves but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves when this spirit of citizenship be miss no government program can replace it when this spirit be present no wrong can stand against it  after the declaration of independence be sign virginia statesman john page write to thomas jefferson ""we know the

clinton, distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, the peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country.', 'with a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings.', 'as i begin, i thank president clinton for his service to our nation.', 'and i thank vice president gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace.', ""i am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of america's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow."", 'we have a place, all of us, in a long story—a story we continue, but whose end we will not see.', 'it is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, a story of a slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.', 'it is the american story—a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals.', 'the grandest of these ideals is an unfolding american promise that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born.', 'americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws.', 'and though our nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.', ""through much of the last century, america's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea."", 'now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations.', 'our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along.', 'and even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel.', 'while many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country.', 'the ambitions of some americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth.', 'and sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country.', 'we do not accept this, and we will not allow it.', 'our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation.', 'and this is my solemn pledge: i will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.', 'i know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in his image.', 'and we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.', 'america has never been united by blood or birth or soil.', 'we are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens.', 'every child must be taught these principles.', 'every citizen must uphold them.', 'and every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, american.', ""today, we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion and character."", 'america, at its best, matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility.', 'a civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness.', 'some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, the stakes of our debates appear small.', 'but the stakes for america are never small.', 'if our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led.', 'if we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism.', 'if we permit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.', 'we must live up to the calling we share.', 'civility is not a tactic or a sentiment.', 'it is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos.', 'and this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.', 'america, at its best, is also courageous.', 'our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defending common dangers defined our common good.', 'now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us.', 'we must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations.', ""together, we will reclaim america's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives."", 'we will reform social security and medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent.', 'and we will reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working americans.', 'we will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge.', 'we will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors.', 'the enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: america remains engaged in the world by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom.', 'we will defend our allies and our interests.', 'we will show purpose without arrogance.', 'we will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength.', 'and to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth.', 'america, at its best, is compassionate.', ""in the quiet of american conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise."", 'and whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault.', 'abandonment and abuse are not acts of god, they are failures of love.', 'and the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our souls.', 'where there is suffering, there is duty.', 'americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities.', 'and all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.', 'government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil rights and common schools.', 'yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government.', ""and some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer."", 'church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws.', 'many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do.', 'and i can pledge our nation to a goal: when we see that wounded traveler on the road to jericho, we will not pass to the other side.', 'america, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected.', 'encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to conscience.', 'and though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment.', 'we find the fullness of life not only in options, but in commitments.', 'and we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free.', 'our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom.', 'sometimes in life we are called to do great things.', 'but as a saint of our times has said, every day we are called to do small things with great love.', 'the most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone.', 'i will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well.', 'in all these ways, i will bring the values of our history to the care of our times.', 'what you do is as important as anything government does.', 'i ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against easy attacks; to serve your nation, beginning with your neighbor.', 'i ask you to be citizens: citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects; responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character.', 'americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves, but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves.', 'when this spirit of citizenship is missing, no government program can replace it.', 'when this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.', 'after the declaration of independence was signed, virginia statesman john page wrote to thomas jefferson: ""we know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong.', 'do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?""', 'much time has passed since jefferson arrived for his inauguration.', 'the years and changes accumulate.', ""but the themes of this day he would know: our nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity."", ""we are not this story's author, who fills time and eternity with his purpose."", 'yet his purpose is achieved in our duty, and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another.', 'never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make our country more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life.', 'this work continues.', 'this story goes on.', 'and an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm.', 'god bless you all, and god bless america.']","['clinton', 'distinguish', 'guests', 'fellow',

George H. W. Bush,"January 20, 1989","
      
      Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Quayle, Senator Mitchell, Speaker Wright, Senator Dole, Congressman Michel, and fellow citizens, neighbors, and friends:
There is a man here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts and in our history. President Reagan, on behalf of our nation, I thank you for the wonderful things that you have done for America.
I've just repeated word for word the oath taken by George Washington 200 years ago, and the Bible on which I placed my hand is the Bible on which he placed his. It is right that the memory of Washington be with us today not only because this is our bicentennial inauguration but because Washington remains the Father of our Country. And he would, I think, be gladdened by this day; for today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact: our continuity, these 200 years, since our government began.
We meet on democracy's front porch. A good place to talk as neighbors and as friends. For this is a day when our nation is made whole, when our differences, for a moment, are suspended. And my first act as President is a prayer. I ask you to bow your heads.
Heavenly Father, we bow our heads and thank You for Your love. Accept our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that makes its continuance likely. Make us strong to do Your work, willing to heed and hear Your will, and write on our hearts these words: ""Use power to help people."" For we are given power not to advance our own purposes, nor to make a great show in the world, nor a name. There is but one just use of power, and it is to serve people. Help us remember, Lord. Amen.
I come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with promise. We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better. For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn. For in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over. The totalitarian era is passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient, lifeless tree. A new breeze is blowing, and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on. There is new ground to be broken and new action to be taken. There are times when the future seems thick as a fog; you sit and wait, hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path. But this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a room called tomorrow.
Great nations of the world are moving toward democracy through the door to freedom. Men and women of the world move toward free markets through the door to prosperity. The people of the world agitate for free expression and free thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only liberty allows.
We know what works: Freedom works. We know what's right: Freedom is right. We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on Earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state.
For the first time in this century, for the first time in perhaps all history, man does not have to invent a system by which to live. We don't have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better. We don't have to wrest justice from the kings. We only have to summon it from within ourselves. We must act on what we know. I take as my guide the hope of a saint: In crucial things, unity; in important things, diversity; in all things, generosity.
America today is a proud, free nation, decent and civil, a place we cannot help but love. We know in our hearts, not loudly and proudly but as a simple fact, that this country has meaning beyond what we see, and that our strength is a force for good. But have we changed as a nation even in our time? Are we enthralled with material things, less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice?
My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions. They are not the measure of our lives. In our hearts we know what matters. We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend; a loving parent; a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood, and town better than he found it. And what do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we're no longer there? That we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship?
No President, no government can teach us to remember what is best in what we are. But if the man you have chosen to lead this government can help make a difference; if he can celebrate the quieter, deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk but of better hearts and finer souls; if he can do these things, then he must.
America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle. We as a people have such a purpose today. It is to make kinder the face of the Nation and gentler the face of the world. My friends, we have work to do. There are the homeless, lost and roaming. There are the children who have nothing, no love and no normalcy. There are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction—drugs, welfare, the demoralization that rules the slums. There is crime to be conquered, the rough crime of the streets. There are young women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children they can't care for and might not love. They need our care, our guidance, and our education, though we bless them for choosing life.
The old solution, the old way, was to think that public money alone could end these problems. But we have learned that that is not so. And in any case, our funds are low. We have a deficit to bring down. We have more will than wallet, but will is what we need. We will make the hard choices, looking at what we have and perhaps allocating it differently, making our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety. And then we will do the wisest thing of all. We will turn to the only resource we have that in times of need always grows: the goodness and the courage of the American people.
And I am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others, a new activism, hands-on and involved, that gets the job done. We must bring in the generations, harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the young. For not only leadership is passed from generation to generation but so is stewardship. And the generation born after the Second World War has come of age.
I have spoken of a Thousand Points of Light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good. We will work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading, sometimes being led, rewarding. We will work on this in the White House, in the Cabinet agencies. I will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light, and I'll ask every member of my government to become involved. The old ideas are new again because they're not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in.
We need a new engagement, too, between the Executive and the Congress. The challenges before us will be thrashed out with the House and the Senate. And we must bring the Federal budget into balance. And we must ensure that America stands before the world united, strong, at peace, and fiscally sound. But of course things may be difficult. We need to compromise; we've had dissension. We need harmony; we've had a chorus of discordant voices.
For Congress, too, has changed in our time. There has grown a certain divisiveness. We have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not each other's ideas are challenged but each other's motives. And our great parties have too often been far apart and untrusting of each other. It's been this way since Vietnam. That war cleaves us still. But, friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago, and surely the statute of limitation has been reached. This is a fact: The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory. A new breeze is blowing, and the old bipartisanship must be made new again.
To my friends, and, yes, I do mean friends—in the loyal opposition and, yes, I mean loyal—I put out my hand. I am putting out my hand to you, Mr. Speaker. I am putting out my hand to you, Mr. Majority Leader. For this is the thing: This is the age of the offered hand. And we can't turn back clocks, and I don't want to. But when our fathers were young, Mr. Speaker, our differences ended at the water's edge. And we don't wish to turn back time, but when our mothers were young, Mr. Majority Leader, the Congress and the Executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on which this nation could live. Let us negotiate soon and hard. But in the end, let us produce. The American people await action. They didn't send us here to bicker. They ask us to rise above the merely partisan. ""In crucial things, unity""—and this, my friends, is crucial.
To the world, too, we offer new engagement and a renewed vow: We will stay strong to protect the peace. The offered hand is a reluctant fist; once made—strong, and can be used with great effect. There are today Americans who are held against their will in foreign lands and Americans who are unaccounted for. Assistance can be shown here and will be long remembered. Good will begets good will. Good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on.
Great nations like great men must keep their word. When America says something, America means it, whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow made on marble steps. We will always try to speak clearly, for candor is a compliment; but subtlety, too, is good and has its place. While keeping our alliances and friendships around the world strong, ever strong, we will continue the new closeness with the Soviet Union, consistent both with our security and with progress. One might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumph of hope and strength over experience. But hope is good, and so is strength and vigilance.
Here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the understandable satisfaction of those who have taken part in democracy and seen their hopes fulfilled. But my thoughts have been turning the past few days to those who would be watching at home, to an older fellow who will throw a salute by himself when the flag goes by and the woman who will tell her sons the words of the battle hymns. I don't mean this to be sentimental. I mean that on days like this we remember that we are all part of a continuum, inescapably connected by the ties that bind.
Our children are watching in schools throughout our great land. And to them I say, Thank you for watching democracy's big day. For democracy belongs to us all, and freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go higher and higher with the breeze. And to all I say, No matter what your circumstances or where you are, you are part of this day, you are part of the life of our great nation.
A President is neither prince nor pope, and I don't seek a window on men's souls. In fact, I yearn for a greater tolerance, and easygoingness about each other's attitudes and way of life.
There are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united and express our intolerance. The most obvious now is drugs. And when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship, it may as well have been a deadly bacteria, so much has it hurt the body, the soul of our country. And there is much to be done and to be said, but take my word for it: This scourge will stop!
And so, there is much to do. And tomorrow the work begins. And I do not mistrust the future. I do not fear what is ahead. For our problems are large, but our heart is larger. Our challenges are great, but our will is greater. And if our flaws are endless, God's love is truly boundless.
Some see leadership as high drama and the sound of trumpets calling, and sometimes it is that. But I see history as a book with many pages, and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning. The new breeze blows, a page turns, the story unfolds. And so, today a chapter begins, a small and stately story of unity, diversity, and generosity—shared, and written, together.
Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.

that we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us? or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship?  no president, no government can teach us to remember what is best in what we are. but if the man you have chosen to lead this government can help make a difference; if he can celebrate the quieter, deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk but of better hearts and finer souls; if he can do these things, then he must.  america is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle. we as a people have such a purpose today. it is to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world. my friends, we have work to do. there are the homeless, lost and roaming. there are the children who have nothing, no love and no normalcy. there are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction—drugs, welfare, the demoralization that rules the slums. there is crime to be conquered, the rough crime of the streets. there are young women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children they can't care for and might not love. they need our care, our guidance, and our education, though we bless them for choosing life.  the old solution, the old way, was to think that public money alone could end these problems. but we have learned that that is not so. and in any case, our funds are low. we have a deficit to bring down. we have more will than wallet, but will is what we need. we will make the hard choices, looking at what we have and perhaps allocating it differently, making our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety. and then we will do the wisest thing of all. we will turn to the only resource we have that in times of need always grows: the goodness and the courage of the american people.  and i am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others, a new activism, hands-on and involved, that gets the job done. we must bring in the generations, harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the young. for not only leadership is passed from generation to generation but so is stewardship. and the generation born after the second world war has come of age.  i have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the nation, doing good. we will work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading, sometimes being led, rewarding. we will work on this in the white house, in the cabinet agencies. i will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light, and i'll ask every member of my government to become involved. the old ideas are new again because they're not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in.  we need a new engagement, too, between the executive and the congress. the challenges before us will be thrashed out with the house and the senate. and we must bring the federal budget into balance. and we must ensure that america stands before the world united, strong, at peace, and fiscally sound. but of course things may be difficult. we need to compromise; we've had dissension. we need harmony; we've had a chorus of discordant voices.  for congress, too, has changed in our time. there has grown a certain divisiveness. we have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not each other's ideas are challenged but each other's motives. and our great parties have too often been far apart and untrusting of each other. it's been this way since vietnam. that war cleaves us still. but, friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago, and surely the statute of limitation has been reached. this is a fact: the final lesson of vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory. a new breeze is blowing, and the old bipartisanship must be made new again.  to my friends, and, yes, i do mean friends—in the loyal opposition and, yes, i mean loyal—i put out my hand. i am putting out my hand to you, mr. speaker. i am putting out my hand to you, mr. majority leader. for this is the thing: this is the age of the offered hand. and we can't turn back clocks, and i don't want to. but when our fathers were young, mr. speaker, our differences ended at the water's edge. and we don't wish to turn back time, but when our mothers were young, mr. majority leader, the congress and the executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on which this nation could live. let us negotiate soon and hard. but in the end, let us produce. the american people await action. they didn't send us here to bicker. they ask us to rise above the merely partisan. ""in crucial things, unity""—and this, my friends, is crucial.  to the world, too, we offer new engagement and a renewed vow: we will stay strong to protect the peace. the offered hand is a reluctant fist; once made—strong, and can be used with great effect. there are today americans who are held against their will in foreign lands and americans who are unaccounted for. assistance can be shown here and will be long remembered. good will begets good will. good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on.  great nations like great men must keep their word. when america says something, america means it, whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow made on marble steps. we will always try to speak clearly, for candor is a compliment; but subtlety, too, is good and has its place. while keeping our alliances and friendships around the world strong, ever strong, we will continue the new closeness with the soviet union, consistent both with our security and with progress. one might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumph of hope and strength over experience. but hope is good, and so is strength and vigilance.  here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the understandable satisfaction of those who have taken part in democracy and seen their hopes fulfilled. but my thoughts have been turning the past few days to those who would be watching at home, to an older fellow who will throw a salute by himself when the flag goes by and the woman who will tell her sons the words of the battle hymns. i don't mean this to be sentimental. i mean that on days like this we remember that we are all part of a continuum, inescapably connected by the ties that bind.  our children are watching in schools throughout our great land. and to them i say, thank you for watching democracy's big day. for democracy belongs to us all, and freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go higher and higher with the breeze. and to all i say, no matter what your circumstances or where you are, you are part of this day, you are part of the life of our great nation.  a president is neither prince nor pope, and i don't seek a window on men's souls. in fact, i yearn for a greater tolerance, and easygoingness about each other's attitudes and way of life.  there are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united and express our intolerance. the most obvious now is drugs. and when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship, it may as well have been a deadly bacteria, so much has it hurt the body, the soul of our country. and there is much to be done and to be said, but take my word for it: this scourge will stop!  and so, there is much to do. and tomorrow the work begins. and i do not mistrust the future. i do not fear what is ahead. for our problems are large, but our heart is larger. our challenges are great, but our will is greater. and if our flaws are endless, god's love is truly boundless.  some see leadership as high drama and the sound of trumpets calling, and sometimes it is that. but i see history as a book with many pages, and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning. the new breeze blows, a page turns, the story unfolds. and so, today a chapter begins, a small and stately story of unity, diversity, and generosity—shared, and written, together.  thank you. god bless you. and god bless the united states of america.

first act as president be a prayer i ask you to bow your head  heavenly father we bow our head and thank you for your love accept our thank for the peace that yield this day and the share faith that make its continuance likely make us strong to do your work will to heed and hear your will and write on our hearts these word ""use power to help people"" for we be give power not to advance our own purpose nor to make a great show in the world nor a name there be but one just use of power and it be to serve people help us remember lord amen  i come before you and assume the presidency at a moment rich with promise we live in a peaceful prosperous time but we can make it better for a new breeze be blow and a world refresh by freedom seem reborn for in man heart if not in fact the day of the dictator be over the totalitarian era be pass its old ideas blow away like leave from an ancient lifeless tree a new breeze be blow and a nation refresh by freedom stand ready to push on there be new grind to be break and new action to be take there be time when the future seem thick as a fog you sit and wait hop the mist will lift and reveal the right path but this be a time when the future seem a door you can walk right through into a room call tomorrow  great nations of the world be move toward democracy through the door to freedom men and women of the world move toward free market through the door to prosperity the people of the world agitate for free expression and free think through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only liberty allow  we know what work freedom work we know what right freedom be right we know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on earth through free market free speech free elections and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state  for the first time in this century for the first time in perhaps all history man do not have to invent a system by which to live we don't have to talk late into the night about which form of government be better we don't have to wrest justice from the kings we only have to summon it from within ourselves we must act on what we know i take as my guide the hope of a saint in crucial things unity in important things diversity in all things generosity  america today be a proud free nation decent and civil a place we cannot help but love we know in our hearts not loudly and proudly but as a simple fact that this country have mean beyond what we see and that our strength be a force for good but have we change as a nation even in our time be we enthral with material things less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice  my friends we be not the sum of our possessions they be not the measure of our live in our hearts we know what matter we cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car a bigger bank account we must hope to give them a sense of what it mean to be a loyal friend a love parent a citizen who leave his home his neighborhood and town better than he find it and what do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we're no longer there that we be more drive to succeed than anyone around us or that we stop to ask if a sick child have get better and stay a moment there to trade a word of friendship  no president no government can teach us to remember what be best in what we be but if the man you have choose to lead this government can help make a difference if he can celebrate the quieter deeper successes that be make not of gold and silk but of better hearts and finer souls if he can do these things then he must  america be never wholly herself unless she be engage in high moral principle we as a people have such a purpose today it be to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world my friends we have work to do there be the homeless lose and roam there be the children who have nothing no love and no normalcy there be those who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction—drugs welfare the demoralization that rule the slum there be crime to be conquer the rough crime of the streets there be young women to be help who be about to become mother of children they can't care for and might not love they need our care our guidance and our education though we bless them for choose life  the old solution the old way be to think that public money alone could end these problems but we have learn that that be not so and in any case our fund be low we have a deficit to bring down we have more will than wallet but will be what we need we will make the hard choices look at what we have and perhaps allocate it differently make our decisions base on honest need and prudent safety and then we will do the wisest thing of all we will turn to the only resource we have that in time of need always grow the goodness and the courage of the american people  and i be speak of a new engagement in the live of others a new activism hands-on and involve that get the job do we must bring in the generations harness the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the young for not only leadership be pass from generation to generation but so be stewardship and the generation bear after the second world war have come of age  i have speak of a thousand point of light of all the community organizations that be spread like star throughout the nation do good we will work hand in hand encourage sometimes lead sometimes be lead reward we will work on this in the white house in the cabinet agencies i will go to the people and the program that be the brighter point of light and i'll ask every member of my government to become involve the old ideas be new again because they're not old they be timeless duty sacrifice commitment and a patriotism that find its expression in take part and pitch in  we need a new engagement too between the executive and the congress the challenge before us will be thrash out with the house and the senate and we must bring the federal budget into balance and we must ensure that america stand before the world unite strong at peace and fiscally sound but of course things may be difficult we need to compromise we've have dissension we need harmony we've have a chorus of discordant voice  for congress too have change in our time there have grow a certain divisiveness we have see the hard look and hear the statements in which not each other ideas be challenge but each other motives and our great party have too often be far apart and untrusting of each other it be this way since vietnam that war cleave us still but friends that war begin in earnest a quarter of a century ago and surely the statute of limitation have be reach this be a fact the final lesson of vietnam be that no great nation can long afford to be sunder by a memory a new breeze be blow and the old bipartisanship must be make new again  to my friends and yes i do mean friends—in the loyal opposition and yes i mean loyal—i put out my hand i be put out my hand to you mr speaker i be put out my hand to you mr majority leader for this be the thing this be the age of the offer hand and we can't turn back clock and i don't want to but when our father be young mr speaker our differences end at the water edge and we don't wish to turn back time but when our mother be young mr majority leader the congress and the executive be capable of work together to produce a budget on which this nation could live let us negotiate soon and hard but in the end let us produce the american people await action they didn't send us here to bicker they ask us to rise above the merely partisan ""in crucial things unity""—and this my friends be crucial  to the world too we offer new engagement and a renew vow we will stay strong to protect the peace the offer hand be a reluctant fist once made—strong and can be use with great effect there be today americans who be hold against their will in foreign land and americans who be unaccounted for assistance can be show here and will be long remember good will beget good will good faith can be a spiral that endlessly move on  great nations like great men must keep their word when america say something america mean it whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow make on marble step we will always try to speak clearly for candor be a compliment but subtlety too be good and have its place while keep our alliances and friendships around the world strong ever strong we will continue the new closeness with the soviet union consistent both with our security and with progress one might say that our new relationship in part reflect the triumph of hope and strength over experience but hope be good and so be strength and vigilance  here today be tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the understandable satisfaction of those who have take part in democracy and see their hop fulfil but my thoughts have be turn the past few days to those who would be watch at home to an older fellow who will throw a salute by himself when the flag go by and the woman who will tell her sons the word of the battle hymn i don't mean this to be sentimental i mean that on days like this we remember that we be all part of a continuum inescapably connect by the tie that bind  our children be watch in school throughout our great land and to them i say thank you for watch democracy big day for democracy belong to us all and freedom be like a beautiful kite that can go higher and higher with the breeze and to all i say no matter what your circumstances or where you be you be part of this day you be part of the life of our great nation  a president be neither prince nor pope and i don't seek a window on men souls in fact i yearn for a greater tolerance and easygoingness about each other attitudes and way of life  there be few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up unite and express our intolerance the most obvious now be drug and when that first cocaine be smuggle in on a ship it may as well have be a deadly bacteria so much have it hurt the body the soul of our country and there be much to be do and to be say but take my word for it this scourge will stop  and so there be much to do and tomorrow the work begin and i do not mistrust the future i do not fear what be ahead for our problems be large but our heart be larger our challenge be great but our will be greater and if our flaw be endless god love be truly boundless  some see leadership as high drama and the sound of trumpet call and sometimes it be that but i see history as a book with many page and each day we fill a page with act of hopefulness and mean the new breeze blow a page turn the story unfold and so today a chapter begin a small and stately story of unity diversity and

president, vice president quayle, senator mitchell, speaker wright, senator dole, congressman michel, and fellow citizens, neighbors, and friends:  there is a man here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts and in our history.', 'president reagan, on behalf of our nation, i thank you for the wonderful things that you have done for america.', ""i've just repeated word for word the oath taken by george washington 200 years ago, and the bible on which i placed my hand is the bible on which he placed his."", 'it is right that the memory of washington be with us today not only because this is our bicentennial inauguration but because washington remains the father of our country.', 'and he would, i think, be gladdened by this day; for today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact: our continuity, these 200 years, since our government began.', ""we meet on democracy's front porch."", 'a good place to talk as neighbors and as friends.', 'for this is a day when our nation is made whole, when our differences, for a moment, are suspended.', 'and my first act as president is a prayer.', 'i ask you to bow your heads.', 'heavenly father, we bow our heads and thank you for your love.', 'accept our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that makes its continuance likely.', 'make us strong to do your work, willing to heed and hear your will, and write on our hearts these words: ""use power to help people.""', 'for we are given power not to advance our own purposes, nor to make a great show in the world, nor a name.', 'there is but one just use of power, and it is to serve people.', 'help us remember, lord.', 'amen.', 'i come before you and assume the presidency at a moment rich with promise.', 'we live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better.', 'for a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn.', ""for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the dictator is over."", 'the totalitarian era is passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient, lifeless tree.', 'a new breeze is blowing, and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on.', 'there is new ground to be broken and new action to be taken.', 'there are times when the future seems thick as a fog; you sit and wait, hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path.', 'but this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a room called tomorrow.', 'great nations of the world are moving toward democracy through the door to freedom.', 'men and women of the world move toward free markets through the door to prosperity.', 'the people of the world agitate for free expression and free thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only liberty allows.', 'we know what works: freedom works.', ""we know what's right: freedom is right."", 'we know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state.', 'for the first time in this century, for the first time in perhaps all history, man does not have to invent a system by which to live.', ""we don't have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better."", ""we don't have to wrest justice from the kings."", 'we only have to summon it from within ourselves.',

decent and civil, a place we cannot help but love.', 'we know in our hearts, not loudly and proudly but as a simple fact, that this country has meaning beyond what we see, and that our strength is a force for good.', 'but have we changed as a nation even in our time?', 'are we enthralled with material things, less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice?', 'my friends, we are not the sum of our possessions.', 'they are not the measure of our lives.', 'in our hearts we know what matters.', 'we cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account.', 'we must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend; a loving parent; a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood, and town better than he found it.', ""and what do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we're no longer there?"", 'that we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us?', 'or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship?', 'no president, no government can teach us to remember what is best in what we are.', 'but if the man you have chosen to lead this government can help make a difference; if he can celebrate the quieter, deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk but of better hearts and finer souls; if he can do these things, then he must.', 'america is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle.', 'we as a people have such a purpose today.', 'it is to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world.', 'my friends, we have work to do.', 'there are the homeless, lost and roaming.', 'there are the children who have nothing, no love and no normalcy.', 'there are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction—drugs, welfare, the demoralization that rules the slums.', 'there is crime to be conquered, the rough crime of the streets.', ""there are young women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children they can't care for and might not love."", 'they need our care, our guidance, and our education, though we bless them for choosing life.', 'the old solution, the old way, was to think that public money alone could end these problems.', 'but we have learned that that is not so.', 'and in any case, our funds are low.', 'we have a deficit to bring down.', 'we have more will than wallet, but will is what we need.', 'we will make the hard choices, looking at what we have and perhaps allocating it differently, making our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety.', 'and then we will do the wisest thing of all.', 'we will turn to the only resource we have that in times of need always grows: the goodness and the courage of the american people.', 'and i am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others, a new activism, hands-on and involved, that gets the job done.', 'we must bring in the generations, harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the young.', 'for not only leadership is passed from generation to generation but so is stewardship.', 'and the generation born after the second world war has come of age.', 'i have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the nation, doing good.', 'we will work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading, sometimes being led, rewarding.', 'we will work on this in the white house, in the cabinet agencies.', ""i will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light, and i'll ask every member of my government to become involved."", ""the old ideas are new again because they're not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in."", 'we need a new engagement, too, between the executive and the congress.', 'the challenges before us will be thrashed out with the house and the senate.', 'and we must bring the federal budget into balance.', 'and we must ensure that america stands before the world united, strong, at peace, and fiscally sound.', 'but of course things may be difficult.', ""we need to compromise; we've had dissension."", ""we need harmony; we've had a chorus of discordant voices."", 'for congress, too, has changed in our time.', 'there has grown a certain divisiveness.', ""we have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not each other's ideas are challenged but each other's motives."", 'and our great parties have too often been far apart and untrusting of each other.', ""it's been this way since vietnam."", 'that war cleaves us still.', 'but, friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago, and surely the statute of limitation has been reached.', 'this is a fact: the final lesson of vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory.', 'a new breeze is blowing, and the old bipartisanship must be made new again.', 'to my friends, and, yes, i do mean friends—in the loyal opposition and, yes, i mean loyal—i put out my hand.', 'i am putting out my hand to you, mr. speaker.', 'i am putting out my hand to you, mr. majority leader.', 'for this is the thing: this is the age of the offered hand.', ""and we can't turn back clocks, and i don't want to."", ""but when our fathers were young, mr. speaker, our differences ended at the water's edge."", ""and we don't wish to turn back time, but when our mothers were young, mr. majority leader, the congress and the executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on which this nation could live."", 'let us negotiate soon and hard.', 'but in the end, let us produce.', 'the american people await action.', ""they didn't send us here to bicker."", 'they ask us to rise above the merely partisan.', '""in crucial things, unity""—and this, my friends, is crucial.', 'to the world, too, we offer new engagement and a renewed vow: we will stay strong to protect the peace.', 'the offered hand is a reluctant fist; once made—strong, and can be used with great effect.', 'there are today americans who are held against their will in foreign lands and americans who are unaccounted for.', 'assistance can be shown here and will be long remembered.', 'good will begets good will.', 'good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on.', 'great nations like great men must keep their word.', 'when america says something, america means it, whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow made on marble steps.', 'we will always try to speak clearly, for candor is a compliment; but subtlety, too, is good and has its place.', 'while keeping our alliances and friendships around the world strong, ever strong, we will continue the new closeness with the soviet union, consistent both with our security and with progress.', 'one might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumph of hope and strength over experience.', 'but hope is good, and so is strength and vigilance.', 'here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the understandable satisfaction of those who have taken part in democracy and seen their hopes fulfilled.', 'but my thoughts have been turning the past few days to those who would be watching at home, to an older fellow who will throw a salute by himself when the flag goes by and the woman who will tell her sons the words of the battle hymns.', ""i don't mean this to be sentimental."", 'i mean that on days like this we remember that we are all part of a continuum, inescapably connected by the ties that bind.', 'our children are watching in schools throughout our great land.', ""and to them i say, thank you for watching democracy's big day."", 'for democracy belongs to us all, and freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go higher and higher with the breeze.', 'and to all i say, no matter what your circumstances or where you are, you are part of this day, you are part of the life of our great nation.', ""a president is neither prince nor pope, and i don't seek a window on men's souls."", ""in fact, i yearn for a greater tolerance, and easygoingness about each other's attitudes and way of life."", 'there are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united and express our intolerance.', 'the most obvious now is drugs.', 'and when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship, it may as well have been a deadly bacteria, so much has it hurt the body, the soul of our country.', 'and there is much to be done and to be said, but take my word for it: this scourge will stop!', 'and so, there is much to do.', 'and tomorrow the work begins.', 'and i do not mistrust the future.', 'i do not fear what is ahead.', 'for our problems are large, but our heart is larger.', 'our challenges are great, but our will is greater.', ""and if our flaws are endless, god's love is truly boundless."", 'some see leadership as high drama and the sound of trumpets calling, and sometimes it is that.', 'but i see history as a book with many pages, and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning.', 'the new breeze blows, a page turns, the story unfolds.', 'and so, today a chapter begins, a small and stately story of unity, diversity, and generosity—shared, and written, together.', 'thank you.', 'god bless you.', 'and god bless the

Ronald Reagan,"January 21, 1985","
      
      Senator Mathias, Chief Justice Burger, Vice President Bush, Speaker O'Neill, Senator Dole, reverend clergy, and members of my family and friends and my fellow citizens:
This day has been made brighter with the presence here of one who, for a time, has been absent. Senator John Stennis, God bless you and welcome back.
There is, however, one who is not with us today. Representative Gillis Long of Louisiana left us last night. And I wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent prayer.
[The President resumed speaking after a moment of silence. ]
Amen.
There are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great honor that you've bestowed on me. I'll do my utmost to be deserving of your trust.
This is, as Senator Mathias told us, the 50th time that we, the people, have celebrated this historic occasion. When the first President, George Washington, placed his hand upon the Bible, he stood less than a single day's journey by horseback from raw, untamed wilderness. There were 4 million Americans in a union of 13 States. Today, we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 States. We've lighted the world with our inventions, gone to the aid of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help, journeyed to the Moon and safely returned. So much has changed, and yet we stand together as we did two centuries ago.
When I took this oath 4 years ago, I did so in a time of economic stress. Voices were raised saying that we had to look to our past for the greatness and glory. But we, the present-day Americans, are not given to looking backward. In this blessed land, there is always a better tomorrow.
Four years ago, I spoke to you of a New Beginning, and we have accomplished that. But in another sense, our New Beginning is a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when, for the first time in history, government, the people said, was not our master, it is our servant; its only power that which we the people allow it to have.
That system has never failed us, but for a time we failed the system. We asked things of government that government was not equipped to give. We yielded authority to the National Government that properly belonged to States or to local governments or to the people themselves. We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had made us the most productive people on Earth slow down and the number of unemployed increase.
By 1980 we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom, consistent with an orderly society.
We believed then and now: There are no limits to growth and human progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams. And we were right to believe that. Tax rates have been reduced, inflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than ever before in our history.
We are creating a nation once again vibrant, robust, and alive. But there are many mountains yet to climb. We will not rest until every American enjoys the fullness of freedom, dignity, and opportunity as our birthright. It is our birthright as citizens of this great Republic.
And if we meet this challenge, these will be years when Americans have restored their confidence and tradition of progress; when our values of faith, family, work, and neighborhood were restated for a modern age; when our economy was finally freed from government's grip; when we made sincere efforts at meaningful arms reductions and by rebuilding our defenses, our economy, and developing new technologies, helped preserve peace in a troubled world; when America courageously supported the struggle for individual liberty, self-government, and free enterprise throughout the world and turned the tide of history away from totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom.
My fellow citizens, our nation is poised for greatness. We must do what we know is right, and do it with all our might. Let history say of us: ""These were golden years—when the American Revolution was reborn, when freedom gained new life, and America reached for her best.
Our two-party system has solved us—served us, I should say, well over the years, but never better than in those times of great challenge when we came together not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in a common cause.
Two of our Founding Fathers, a Boston lawyer named Adams and a Virginia planter named Jefferson, members of that remarkable group who met in Independence Hall and dared to think they could start the world over again, left us an important lesson. They had become, in the years then in government, bitter political rivals in the Presidential election of 1800. Then, years later, when both were retired and age had softened their anger, they began to speak to each other again through letters. A bond was reestablished between those two who had helped create this government of ours.
In 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, they both died. They died on the same day, within a few hours of each other, and that day was the Fourth of July.
In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives, Jefferson wrote: ""It carries me back to the times when, beset with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right of self-government. Laboring always at the same oar, with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless... we rode through the storm with heart and hand.""
Well, with heart and hand let us stand as one today—one people under God, determined that our future shall be worthy of our past. As we do, we must not repeat the well-intentioned errors of our past. We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling demands of a bloated Federal Establishment. You elected us in 1980 to end this prescription for disaster, and I don't believe you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course.
At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight months of economic growth: Freedom and incentives unleash the drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress. We have begun to increase the rewards for work, savings, and investment; reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in people's lives.
We must simplify our tax system, make it more fair and bring the rates down for all who work and earn. We must think anew and move with a new boldness, so every American who seeks work can find work, so the least among us shall have an equal chance to achieve the greatest things—to be heroes who heal our sick, feed the hungry, protect peace among nations, and leave this world a better place.
The time has come for a new American emancipation—a great national drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country. My friends, together we can do this, and do it we must, so help me God.
From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more productive, fulfilled, and united people, and a stronger America—an America that will lead the technological revolution and also open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature, music, and poetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love.
A dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying taxes, will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits. But an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought us to a time of reckoning. We've come to a turning point, a moment for hard decisions. I have asked the Cabinet and my staff a question and now I put the same question to all of you. If not us, who? And if not now, when? It must be done by all of us going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget. We can then begin reducing the national debt.
I will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing government program spending for the next year. Beyond this, we must take further steps to permanently control government's power to tax and spend. We must act now to protect future generations from government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due. Let us make it unconstitutional for the Federal Government to spend more than the Federal Government takes in.
We have already started returning to the people and to State and local governments responsibilities better handled by them. Now, there is a place for the Federal Government in matters of social compassion. But our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged. And here, a growing economy and support from family and community offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way of life, where the old and infirm are cared for, the young and, yes, the unborn protected, and the unfortunate looked after and made self-sufficient.
Now, there is another area where the Federal Government can play a part. As an older American, I remember a time when people of different race, creed, or ethnic origin in our land found hatred and prejudice installed in social custom and, yes, in law. There's no story more heartening in our history than the progress that we've made toward the brotherhood of man that God intended for us. Let us resolve there will be no turning back or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity and abundant with opportunity for all our citizens.
Let us resolve that we, the people, will build an American opportunity society in which all of us—white and black, rich and poor, young and old—will go forward together, arm in arm. Again, let us remember that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner of the Earth, we are all Americans, pledged to carry on this last, best hope of man on Earth.
I've spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations we should put on our National Government. Now let me turn to a task that is the primary responsibility of National Government—the safety and security of our people.
Today, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on Earth. Yet history has shown that peace does not come, nor will our freedom be preserved, by good will alone. There are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and freedom. One nation, the Soviet Union, has conducted the greatest military buildup in the history of man, building arsenals of awesome offensive weapons.
We've made progress in restoring our defense capability. But much remains to be done. There must be no wavering by us, nor any doubts by others, that America will meet her responsibilities to remain free, secure, and at peace.
There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security, and that is to reduce the need for it. And this we're trying to do in negotiations with the Soviet Union. We're not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons; we seek, instead, to reduce their number. We seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.
Now, for decades, we and the Soviets have lived under the threat of mutual assured destruction—if either resorted to the use of nuclear weapons, the other could retaliate and destroy the one who had started it. Is there either logic or morality in believing that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs?
I have approved a research program to find, if we can, a security shield that will destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target. It wouldn't kill people; it would destroy weapons. It wouldn't militarize space; it would help demilitarize the arsenals of Earth. It would render nuclear weapons obsolete. We will meet with the Soviets, hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of nuclear destruction.
We strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes all around us. Since the turn of the century, the number of democracies in the world has grown fourfold. Human freedom is on the march, and nowhere more so than in our own hemisphere. Freedom is one of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit. People, worldwide, hunger for the right of self-determination, for those inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress.
America must remain freedom's staunchest friend, for freedom is our best ally and it is the world's only hope to conquer poverty and preserve peace. Every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark allies of oppression and war. Every victory for human freedom will be a victory for world peace.
So, we go forward today, a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its purpose. With our alliances strengthened, with our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion, we look to a future rich in possibilities. And all of this is because we worked and acted together, not as members of political parties but as Americans.
My friends, we live in a world that's lit by lightning. So much is changing and will change, but so much endures and transcends time.
History is a ribbon, always unfurling. History is a journey. And as we continue our journey, we think of those who traveled before us. We stand again at the steps of this symbol of our democracy—well, we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn't gotten so cold. [Laughter] Now we're standing inside this symbol of our democracy, and we see and hear again the echoes of our past: a general falls to his knees in the hard snow of Valley Forge; a lonely President paces the darkened halls and ponders his struggle to preserve the Union; the men of the Alamo call out encouragement to each other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and the song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air.
It is the American sound. It is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic, daring, decent, and fair. That's our heritage, that's our song. We sing it still. For all our problems, our differences, we are together as of old. We raise our voices to the God who is the Author of this most tender music. And may He continue to hold us close as we fill the world with our sound—in unity, affection, and love—one people under God, dedicated to the dream of freedom that He has placed in the human heart, called upon now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world.
God bless you, and God bless America.

reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in people's lives.  we must simplify our tax system, make it more fair and bring the rates down for all who work and earn. we must think anew and move with a new boldness, so every american who seeks work can find work, so the least among us shall have an equal chance to achieve the greatest things—to be heroes who heal our sick, feed the hungry, protect peace among nations, and leave this world a better place.  the time has come for a new american emancipation—a great national drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country. my friends, together we can do this, and do it we must, so help me god.  from new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more productive, fulfilled, and united people, and a stronger america—an america that will lead the technological revolution and also open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature, music, and poetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love.  a dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying taxes, will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits. but an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought us to a time of reckoning. we've come to a turning point, a moment for hard decisions. i have asked the cabinet and my staff a question and now i put the same question to all of you. if not us, who? and if not now, when? it must be done by all of us going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget. we can then begin reducing the national debt.  i will shortly submit a budget to the congress aimed at freezing government program spending for the next year. beyond this, we must take further steps to permanently control government's power to tax and spend. we must act now to protect future generations from government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due. let us make it unconstitutional for the federal government to spend more than the federal government takes in.  we have already started returning to the people and to state and local governments responsibilities better handled by them. now, there is a place for the federal government in matters of social compassion. but our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged. and here, a growing economy and support from family and community offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way of life, where the old and infirm are cared for, the young and, yes, the unborn protected, and the unfortunate looked after and made self-sufficient.  now, there is another area where the federal government can play a part. as an older american, i remember a time when people of different race, creed, or ethnic origin in our land found hatred and prejudice installed in social custom and, yes, in law. there's no story more heartening in our history than the progress that we've made toward the brotherhood of man that god intended for us. let us resolve there will be no turning back or hesitation on the road to an america rich in dignity and abundant with opportunity for all our citizens.  let us resolve that we, the people, will build an american opportunity society in which all of us—white and black, rich and poor, young and old—will go forward together, arm in arm. again, let us remember that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner of the earth, we are all americans, pledged to carry on this last, best hope of man on earth.  i've spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations we should put on our national government. now let me turn to a task that is the primary responsibility of national government—the safety and security of our people.  today, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on earth. yet history has shown that peace does not come, nor will our freedom be preserved, by good will alone. there are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and freedom. one nation, the soviet union, has conducted the greatest military buildup in the history of man, building arsenals of awesome offensive weapons.  we've made progress in restoring our defense capability. but much remains to be done. there must be no wavering by us, nor any doubts by others, that america will meet her responsibilities to remain free, secure, and at peace.  there is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security, and that is to reduce the need for it. and this we're trying to do in negotiations with the soviet union. we're not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons; we seek, instead, to reduce their number. we seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth.  now, for decades, we and the soviets have lived under the threat of mutual assured destruction—if either resorted to the use of nuclear weapons, the other could retaliate and destroy the one who had started it. is there either logic or morality in believing that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs?  i have approved a research program to find, if we can, a security shield that will destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target. it wouldn't kill people; it would destroy weapons. it wouldn't militarize space; it would help demilitarize the arsenals of earth. it would render nuclear weapons obsolete. we will meet with the soviets, hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of nuclear destruction.  we strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes all around us. since the turn of the century, the number of democracies in the world has grown fourfold. human freedom is on the march, and nowhere more so than in our own hemisphere. freedom is one of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit. people, worldwide, hunger for the right of self-determination, for those inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress.  america must remain freedom's staunchest friend, for freedom is our best ally and it is the world's only hope to conquer poverty and preserve peace. every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark allies of oppression and war. every victory for human freedom will be a victory for world peace.  so, we go forward today, a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its purpose. with our alliances strengthened, with our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion, we look to a future rich in possibilities. and all of this is because we worked and acted together, not as members of political parties but as americans.  my friends, we live in a world that's lit by lightning. so much is changing and will change, but so much endures and transcends time.  history is a ribbon, always unfurling. history is a journey. and as we continue our journey, we think of those who traveled before us. we stand again at the steps of this symbol of our democracy—well, we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn't gotten so cold. [laughter] now we're standing inside this symbol of our democracy, and we see and hear again the echoes of our past: a general falls to his knees in the hard snow of valley forge; a lonely president paces the darkened halls and ponders his struggle to preserve the union; the men of the alamo call out encouragement to each other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and the song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air.  it is the american sound. it is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic, daring, decent, and fair. that's our heritage, that's our song. we sing it still. for all our problems, our differences, we are together as of old. we raise our voices to the god who is the author of this most tender music. and may he continue to hold us close as we fill the world with our sound—in unity, affection, and love—one people under god, dedicated to the dream of freedom that he has placed in the human heart, called upon now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world.  god bless you, and god bless america.  ","    senator mathias chief justice burger vice president bush speaker o'neill senator dole reverend clergy and members of my family and friends and my fellow citizens  this day has been made brighter with the presence here of one who for a time has been absent senator john stennis god bless you and welcome back  there is however one who is not with us today representative gillis long of louisiana left us last night and i wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent prayer  [the president resumed speaking after a moment of silence ]  amen  there are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great honor that you've bestowed on me i'll do my utmost to be deserving of your trust  this is as senator mathias told us the 50th time that we the people have celebrated this historic occasion when the first president george washington placed his hand upon the bible he stood less than a single day's journey by horseback from raw untamed wilderness there were 4 million americans in a union of 13 states today we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 states we've lighted the world with our inventions gone to the aid of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help journeyed to the moon and safely returned so much has changed and yet we stand together as we did two centuries ago  when i took this oath 4 years ago i did so in a time of economic stress voices were raised saying that we had to look to our past for the greatness and glory but we the present-day americans are not given to looking backward in this blessed land there is always a better tomorrow  four years ago i spoke to you of a new beginning and we have accomplished that but in another sense our new beginning is a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when for the first time in history government the people said was not our master it is our servant its only power that which we the people allow it to have  that system has never failed us but for a time we failed the system we asked things of government that government was not equipped to give we yielded authority to the national government that properly belonged to states or to local governments or to the people themselves we allowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had made us the most productive people on earth slow down and the number of unemployed increase  by 1980 we knew it was time to renew our faith to strive with all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society  we believed then and now there are no limits to growth and human progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams and we were right to believe that tax rates have been reduced inflation cut dramatically and more people are employed than ever before in our history  we are creating a nation once again vibrant robust and alive but there are many mountains yet to climb we will not rest until every american enjoys the fullness of freedom dignity and opportunity as our birthright it is our birthright as citizens of this great republic  and if we meet this challenge these will be years when americans have

help journey to the moon and safely return so much have change and yet we stand together as we do two centuries ago  when i take this oath 4 years ago i do so in a time of economic stress voice be raise say that we have to look to our past for the greatness and glory but we the present-day americans be not give to look backward in this bless land there be always a better tomorrow  four years ago i speak to you of a new begin and we have accomplish that but in another sense our new begin be a continuation of that begin create two centuries ago when for the first time in history government the people say be not our master it be our servant its only power that which we the people allow it to have  that system have never fail us but for a time we fail the system we ask things of government that government be not equip to give we yield authority to the national government that properly belong to state or to local governments or to the people themselves we allow tax and inflation to rob us of our earn and save and watch the great industrial machine that have make us the most productive people on earth slow down and the number of unemployed increase  by 1980 we know it be time to renew our faith to strive with all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society  we believe then and now there be no limit to growth and human progress when men and women be free to follow their dream and we be right to believe that tax rat have be reduce inflation cut dramatically and more people be employ than ever before in our history  we be create a nation once again vibrant robust and alive but there be many mountains yet to climb we will not rest until every american enjoy the fullness of freedom dignity and opportunity as our birthright it be our birthright as citizens of this great republic  and if we meet this challenge these will be years when americans have restore their confidence and tradition of progress when our value of faith family work and neighborhood be restate for a modern age when our economy be finally free from government grip when we make sincere efforts at meaningful arm reductions and by rebuild our defenses our economy and develop new technologies help preserve peace in a trouble world when america courageously support the struggle for individual liberty self-government and free enterprise throughout the world and turn the tide of history away from totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom  my fellow citizens our nation be poise for greatness we must do what we know be right and do it with all our might let history say of us ""these be golden years—when the american revolution be reborn when freedom gain new life and america reach for her best  our two-party system have solve us—served us i should say well over the years but never better than in those time of great challenge when we come together not as democrats or republicans but as americans unite in a common cause  two of our found father a boston lawyer name adams and a virginia planter name jefferson members of that remarkable group who meet in independence hall and dare to think they could start the world over again leave us an important lesson they have become in the years then in government bitter political rival in the presidential election of 1800 then years later when both be retire and age have soften their anger they begin to speak to each other again through letter a bond be reestablish between those two who have help create this government of ours  in 1826 the 50th anniversary of the declaration of independence they both die they die on the same day within a few hours of each other and that day be the fourth of july  in one of those letter exchange in the sunset of their live jefferson write ""it carry me back to the time when beset with difficulties and dangers we be fellow laborers in the same cause struggle for what be most valuable to man his right of self-government labor always at the same oar with some wave ever ahead threaten to overwhelm us and yet pass harmless we ride through the storm with heart and hand""  well with heart and hand let us stand as one today—one people under god determine that our future shall be worthy of our past as we do we must not repeat the well-intentioned errors of our past we must never again abuse the trust of work men and women by send their earn on a futile chase after the spiral demand of a bloat federal establishment you elect us in 1980 to end this prescription for disaster and i don't believe you reelect us in 1984 to reverse course  at the heart of our efforts be one idea vindicate by 25 straight months of economic growth freedom and incentives unleash the drive and entrepreneurial genius that be the core of human progress we have begin to increase the reward for work save and investment reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in people live  we must simplify our tax system make it more fair and bring the rat down for all who work and earn we must think anew and move with a new boldness so every american who seek work can find work so the least among us shall have an equal chance to achieve the greatest things—to be heroes who heal our sick fee the hungry protect peace among nations and leave this world a better place  the time have come for a new american emancipation—a great national drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distress areas of our country my friends together we can do this and do it we must so help me god  from new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth a more productive fulfil and unite people and a stronger america—an america that will lead the technological revolution and also open its mind and heart and soul to the treasure of literature music and poetry and the value of faith courage and love  a dynamic economy with more citizens work and pay tax will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits but an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spend have finally bring us to a time of reckon we've come to a turn point a moment for hard decisions i have ask the cabinet and my staff a question and now i put the same question to all of you if not us who and if not now when it must be do by all of us go forward with a program aim at reach a balance budget we can then begin reduce the national debt  i will shortly submit a budget to the congress aim at freeze government program spend for the next year beyond this we must take further step to permanently control government power to tax and spend we must act now to protect future generations from government desire to spend its citizens' money and tax them into servitude when the bill come due let us make it unconstitutional for the federal government to spend more than the federal government take in  we have already start return to the people and to state and local governments responsibilities better handle by them now there be a place for the federal government in matter of social compassion but our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who be infirm or disadvantage and here a grow economy and support from family and community offer our best chance for a society where compassion be a way of life where the old and infirm be care for the young and yes the unborn protect and the unfortunate look after and make self-sufficient  now there be another area where the federal government can play a part as an older american i remember a time when people of different race creed or ethnic origin in our land find hatred and prejudice instal in social custom and yes in law there no story more hearten in our history than the progress that we've make toward the brotherhood of man that god intend for us let us resolve there will be no turn back or hesitation on the road to an america rich in dignity and abundant with opportunity for all our citizens  let us resolve that we the people will build an american opportunity society in which all of us—white and black rich and poor young and old—will go forward together arm in arm again let us remember that though our heritage be one of blood line from every corner of the earth we be all americans pledge to carry on this last best hope of man on earth  i've speak of our domestic goals and the limitations we should put on our national government now let me turn to a task that be the primary responsibility of national government—the safety and security of our people  today we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on earth yet history have show that peace do not come nor will our freedom be preserve by good will alone there be those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and freedom one nation the soviet union have conduct the greatest military buildup in the history of man build arsenals of awesome offensive weapons  we've make progress in restore our defense capability but much remain to be do there must be no waver by us nor any doubt by others that america will meet her responsibilities to remain free secure and at peace  there be only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security and that be to reduce the need for it and this we're try to do in negotiations with the soviet union we're not just discuss limit on a further increase of nuclear weapons we seek instead to reduce their number we seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth  now for decades we and the soviets have live under the threat of mutual assure destruction—if either resort to the use of nuclear weapons the other could retaliate and destroy the one who have start it be there either logic or morality in believe that if one side threaten to kill tens of millions of our people our only recourse be to threaten kill tens of millions of theirs  i have approve a research program to find if we can a security shield that will destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target it wouldn't kill people it would destroy weapons it wouldn't militarize space it would help demilitarize the arsenals of earth it would render nuclear weapons obsolete we will meet with the soviets hop that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of nuclear destruction  we strive for peace and security hearten by the change all around us since the turn of the century the number of democracies in the world have grow fourfold human freedom be on the march and nowhere more so than in our own hemisphere freedom be one of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit people worldwide hunger for the right of self-determination for those inalienable right that make for human dignity and progress  america must remain freedom staunchest friend for freedom be our best ally and it be the world only hope to conquer poverty and preserve peace every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark ally of oppression and war every victory for human freedom will be a victory for world peace  so we go forward today a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its purpose with our alliances strengthen with our economy lead the world to a new age of economic expansion we look to a future rich in possibilities and all of this be because we work and act together not as members of political party but as americans  my friends we live in a world that light by lightning so much be change and will change but so much endure and transcend time  history be a ribbon always unfurl history be a journey and as we continue our journey we think of those who travel before us we stand again at the step of this symbol of our democracy—well we would have be stand at the step if it hadn't get so cold [laughter] now we're stand inside this symbol of our democracy and we see and hear again the echo of our past a general fall

Ronald Reagan,"January 20, 1981","
      
      Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill, Reverend Moomaw, and my fellow citizens:
To a few of us here today this is a solemn and most momentous occasion, and yet in the history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence. The orderly transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely takes place, as it has for almost two centuries, and few of us stop to think how unique we really are. In the eyes of ma in the world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.
Mr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition. By your gracious cooperation in the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other, and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic.
The business of our nation goes forward. These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history. It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income elderly alike. It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people.
Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, human misery, and personal indignity. Those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.
But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public spending. For decades we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience of the present. To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.
You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we're not bound by that same limitation? We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let there be no misunderstanding: We are going to begin to act, beginning today.
The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades. They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.
In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. From time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people. Well, if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden. The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled out to pay a higher price.
We hear much of special interest groups. Well, our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected. It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines. It is made up of men and women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when we're sick—professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbies, and truckdrivers. They are, in short, ""We the people,"" this breed called Americans.
Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all Americans with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work. Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs. All must share in the productive work of this ""new beginning,"" and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy. With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous America, at peace with itself and the world.
So, as we begin, let us take inventory. We are a nation that has a government—not the other way around. And this makes us special among the nations of the Earth. Our government has no power except that granted it by the people. It is time to check and reverse the growth of government, which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed.
It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government.
Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it's not my intention to do away with government. It is rather to make it work—work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it.
If we look to the answer as to why for so many years we achieved so much, prospered as no other people on Earth, it was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before. Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on Earth. The price for this freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling to pay that price.
It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government. It is time for us to realize that we're too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams. We're not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an inevitable decline. I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing. So, with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal. Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength. And let us renew our faith and our hope.
We have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say that we're in a time when there are not heroes, they just don't know where to look. You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates. Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond. You meet heroes across a counter, and they're on both sides of that counter. There are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity. They're individuals and families whose taxes support the government and whose voluntary gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education. Their patriotism is quiet, but deep. Their values sustain our national life.
Now, I have used the words ""they"" and ""their"" in speaking of these heroes. I could say ""you"" and ""your,"" because I'm addressing the heroes of whom I speak—you, the citizens of this blessed land. Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this administration, so help me God.
We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup. How can we love our country and not love our countrymen; and loving them, reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when they're sick, and provide opportunity to make them self-sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?
Can we solve the problems confronting us? Well, the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic ""yes."" To paraphrase Winston Churchill, I did not take the oath I've just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world's strongest economy.
In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity. Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government. Progress may be slow, measured in inches and feet, not miles, but we will progress. It is time to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden. And these will be our first priorities, and on these principles there will be no compromise.
On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph Warren, president of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow Americans, ""Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired of . . . . On you depend the fortunes of America. You are to decide the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves.""
Well, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves, our children, and our children's children. And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world. We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom.
To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment. We will match loyalty with loyalty. We will strive for mutually beneficial relations. We will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for sale.
As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries, they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of the American people. We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it; we will not surrender for it, now or ever.
Our forbearance should never be misunderstood. Our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will. When action is required to preserve our national security, we will act. We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be, knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having to use that strength.
Above all, we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans do have. Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors.
I'm told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day, and for that I'm deeply grateful. We are a nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free. It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inaugural Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.
This is the first time in our history that this ceremony has been held, as you've been told, on this West Front of the Capitol. Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this city's special beauty and history. At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.
Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man, George Washington, father of our country. A man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly. He led America out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood. Off to one side, the stately memorial to Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration of Independence flames with his eloquence. And then, beyond the Reflecting Pool, the dignified columns of the Lincoln Memorial. Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.
Beyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and on the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery, with its row upon row of simple white markers bearing crosses or Stars of David. They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom.
Each one of those markers is a monument to the kind of hero I spoke of earlier. Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood, The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno, and halfway around the world on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir, and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.
Under one such marker lies a young man, Martin Treptow, who left his job in a small town barbershop in 1917 to go to France with the famed Rainbow Division. There, on the western front, he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire.
We're told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf under the heading, ""My Pledge,"" he had written these words: ""America must win this war. Therefore I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone.""
The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make. It does require, however, our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds, to believe that together with God's help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us.
And after all, why shouldn't we believe that? We are Americans.
God bless you, and thank you.

So, as we begin, let us take inventory. We are a nation that has a government—not the other way around. And this makes us special among the nations of the Earth. Our government has no power except that granted it by the people. It is time to check and reverse the growth of government, which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed.  It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government.  Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it's not my intention to do away with government. It is rather to make it work—work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it.  If we look to the answer as to why for so many years we achieved so much, prospered as no other people on Earth, it was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before. Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on Earth. The price for this freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling to pay that price.  It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government. It is time for us to realize that we're too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams. We're not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an inevitable decline. I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing. So, with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal. Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength. And let us renew our faith and our hope.  We have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say that we're in a time when there are not heroes, they just don't know where to look. You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates. Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond. You meet heroes across a counter, and they're on both sides of that counter. There are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity. They're individuals and families whose taxes support the government and whose voluntary gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education. Their patriotism is quiet, but deep. Their values sustain our national life.  Now, I have used the words ""they"" and ""their"" in speaking of these heroes. I could say ""you"" and ""your,"" because I'm addressing the heroes of whom I speak—you, the citizens of this blessed land. Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this administration, so help me God.  We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup. How can we love our country and not love our countrymen; and loving them, reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when they're sick, and provide opportunity to make them self-sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?  Can we solve the problems confronting us? Well, the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic ""yes."" To paraphrase Winston Churchill, I did not take the oath I've just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world's strongest economy.  In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity. Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government. Progress may be slow, measured in inches and feet, not miles, but we will progress. It is time to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden. And these will be our first priorities, and on these principles there will be no compromise.  On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph Warren, president of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow Americans, ""Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired of . . . . On you depend the fortunes of America. You are to decide the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves.""  Well, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves, our children, and our children's children. And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world. We will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom.  To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment. We will match loyalty with loyalty. We will strive for mutually beneficial relations. We will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for sale.  As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries, they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of the American people. We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it; we will not surrender for it, now or ever.  Our forbearance should never be misunderstood. Our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will. When action is required to preserve our national security, we will act. We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be, knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having to use that strength.  Above all, we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans do have. Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors.  I'm told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day, and for that I'm deeply grateful. We are a nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free. It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inaugural Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.  This is the first time in our history that this ceremony has been held, as you've been told, on this West Front of the Capitol. Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this city's special beauty and history. At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.  Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man, George Washington, father of our country. A man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly. He led America out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood. Off to one side, the stately memorial to Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration of Independence flames with his eloquence. And then, beyond the Reflecting Pool, the dignified columns of the Lincoln Memorial. Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.  Beyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and on the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery, with its row upon row of simple white markers bearing crosses or Stars of David. They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom.  Each one of those markers is a monument to the kind of hero I spoke of earlier. Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood, The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno, and halfway around the world on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir, and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.  Under one such marker lies a young man, Martin Treptow, who left his job in a small town barbershop in 1917 to go to France with the famed Rainbow Division. There, on the western front, he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire.  We're told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf under the heading, ""My Pledge,"" he had written these words: ""America must win this war. Therefore I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone.""  The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make. It does require, however, our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds, to believe that together with God's help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us.  And after all, why shouldn't we believe that? We are Americans.  God bless you, and thank you.  ","    senator hatfield, mr. chief justice, mr. president, vice president bush, vice president mondale, senator baker, speaker o'neill, reverend moomaw, and my fellow citizens:  to a few of us here today this is a solemn and most momentous occasion, and yet in the history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence. the orderly transfer of authority as called for in the constitution routinely takes place, as it has for almost two centuries, and few of us stop to think how unique we really are. in the eyes of ma in the world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.  mr. president, i want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition. by your gracious cooperation in the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other, and i thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our republic.  the business of our nation goes forward. these united states are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. we suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history. it distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income elderly alike. it threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people.  idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, human misery, and personal indignity. those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.  but great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public spending. for decades we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience of the present. to continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.  you and i, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time. why, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we're not bound by that same limitation? we must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. and let there be no misunderstanding: we are going to begin to act, beginning today.  the economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades. they will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. they will go away because we as americans have the capacity now, as we've had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.  in this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. from time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people. well, if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? all of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden. the solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled out to pay a higher price.  we hear much of special interest groups. well, our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected. it knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines. it is made up of men and women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when we're sick—professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbies, and truckdrivers. they are, in short, ""we the people,"" this breed called americans.  well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all americans with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. putting america back to work means putting all americans back to work. ending inflation means freeing all americans from the terror of runaway living costs. all must share in the productive work of this ""new beginning,"" and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy. with the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous america, at peace with itself and the world.  so, as we begin, let us take inventory. we are a nation that has a government—not the other way around. and this makes us special among the nations of the earth. our government has no power except that granted it by the people. it is time to check and reverse the growth of government, which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed.  it is my intention to curb the size and influence of the federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the federal government and those reserved to the states or to the people. all of us need to be reminded that the federal government did not create the states;

penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity  but great as our tax burden is it has not kept pace with public spending for decades we have piled deficit upon deficit mortgaging our future and our children future for the temporary convenience of the present to continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social cultural political and economic upheavals  you and i as individuals can by borrowing live beyond our means but for only a limited period of time why then should we think that collectively as a nation we're not bound by that same limitation we must act today in order to preserve tomorrow and let there be no misunderstanding we are going to begin to act beginning today  the economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades they will not go away in days weeks or months but they will go away they will go away because we as americans have the capacity now as we've had in the past to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom  in this present crisis government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem from time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule that government by an elite group is superior to government for by and of the people well if no one among us is capable of governing himself then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else all of us together in and out of government must bear the burden the solutions we seek must be equitable with no one group singled out to pay a higher price  we hear much of special interest groups well our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected it knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions and it crosses political party lines it is made up of men and women who raise our food patrol our streets man our mines and factories teach our children keep our homes and heal us when we're sick—professionals industrialists shopkeepers clerks cabbies and truckdrivers they are in short ""we the people"" this breed called americans  well this administration objective will be a healthy vigorous growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all americans with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination putting america back to work means putting all americans back to work ending inflation means freeing all americans from the terror of runaway living costs all must share in the productive work of this ""new beginning"" and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy with the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength we can have a strong and prosperous america at peace with itself and the world  so as we begin let us take inventory we are a nation that has a government—not the other way around and this makes us special among the nations of the earth our government has no power except that granted it by the people it is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed  it is my intention to curb the size and influence of the federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the federal government and those reserved to the states or to the people all of us need to be reminded that the federal government did not create the states the states created the federal government  now so there will be no misunderstanding it not my intention to do away with government it is rather to make it work—work with us not over us to stand by our side not ride on our back government can and must provide opportunity not smother it foster productivity not stifle it  if we look to the answer as to why for so many years we achieved so much prospered as no other people on earth it was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on earth the price for this freedom at times has been high but we have never been unwilling to pay that price  it is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government it is time for us to realize that we're too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams we're not as some would have us believe doomed to an inevitable decline i do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do i do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing so with all the creative energy at our command let us begin an era of national renewal let us renew our determination our courage and our strength and let us renew our faith and our hope  we have every right to dream heroic dreams those who say that we're in a time when there are not heroes they just don't know where to look you can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates others a handful in number produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond you meet heroes across a counter and they're on both sides of that counter there are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs new wealth and opportunity they're individuals and families whose taxes support the government and whose voluntary gifts support church charity culture art and education their patriotism is quiet but deep their values sustain our national life  now i have used the words ""they"" and ""their"" in speaking of these heroes i could say ""you"" and ""your"" because i'm addressing the heroes of whom i speak—you the citizens of this blessed land your dreams your hopes your goals are going to be the dreams the hopes and the goals of this administration so help me god  we shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup how can we love our country and not love our countrymen and loving them reach out a hand when they fall heal them when they're sick and provide opportunity to make them self-sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory  can we solve the problems confronting us well the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic ""yes"" to paraphrase winston churchill i did not take the oath i've just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world strongest economy  in the days ahead i will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government progress may be slow measured in inches and feet not miles but we will progress it is time to reawaken this industrial giant to get government back within its means and to lighten our punitive tax burden and these will be our first priorities and on these principles there will be no compromise  on the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have been one of the greatest among the founding fathers dr joseph warren president of the massachusetts congress said to his fellow americans ""our country is in danger but not to be despaired of     on you depend the fortunes of america you are to decide the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn act worthy of yourselves""  well i believe we the americans of today are ready to act worthy of ourselves ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves our children and our children children and as we renew ourselves here in our own land we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world we will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom  to those neighbors and allies who share our freedom we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment we will match loyalty with loyalty we will strive for mutually beneficial relations we will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty for our own sovereignty is not for sale  as for the enemies of freedom those who are potential adversaries they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of the american people we will negotiate for it sacrifice for it we will not surrender for it now or ever  our forbearance should never be misunderstood our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will when action is required to preserve our national security we will act we will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having to use that strength  above all we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women it is a weapon our adversaries in today world do not have it is a weapon that we as americans do have let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors  i'm told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day and for that i'm deeply grateful we are a nation under god and i believe god intended for us to be free it would be fitting and good i think if on each inaugural day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer  this is the first time in our history that this ceremony has been held as you've been told on this west front of the capitol standing here one faces a magnificent vista opening up on this city special beauty and history at the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand  directly in front of me the monument to a monumental man george washington father of our country a man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly he led america out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood off to one side the stately memorial to thomas jefferson the declaration of independence flames with his eloquence and then beyond the reflecting pool the dignified columns of the lincoln memorial whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of america will find it in the life of abraham lincoln  beyond those monuments to heroism is the potomac river and on the far shore the sloping hills of arlington national cemetery with its row upon row of simple white markers bearing crosses or stars of david they add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom  each one of those markers is a monument to the kind of hero i spoke of earlier their lives ended in places called belleau wood the argonne omaha beach salerno and halfway around the world on guadalcanal tarawa pork chop hill the chosin reservoir and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called vietnam  under one such marker lies a young man martin treptow who left his job in a small town barbershop in 1917 to go to france with the famed rainbow division there on the western front he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire  we're told that on his body was found a diary on the flyleaf under the heading ""my pledge"" he had written these words ""america must win this war therefore i will work i will save i will sacrifice i will endure i will fight cheerfully and do my utmost as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone""  the crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that martin treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make it does require however our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds to believe that together with god help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us  and after all why shouldn't we believe that we are americans  god bless you and thank you  ","    senator hatfield mr chief justice mr president vice president bush vice president mondale senator baker speaker o'neill reverend moomaw and my fellow citizens  to a few of us here today this be a solemn and most momentous occasion and yet in the history of our nation it be a commonplace occurrence the orderly transfer of authority as call for in the constitution routinely take place as it have for almost two centuries and few of us stop to think how unique we really be in the eye of ma in the world this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal be nothing less than a miracle  mr president i want our fellow citizens to know how much you do to carry on this tradition by your gracious cooperation in the transition process you have show a watch world that we be a unite people pledge to maintain a political system which

Jimmy Carter,"January 20, 1977","
      
      For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.

In this outward and physical ceremony we attest once again to the inner and spiritual strength of our Nation. As my high school teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, used to say: ""We must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles.""

Here before me is the Bible used in the inauguration of our first President, in 1789, and I have just taken the oath of office on the Bible my mother gave me a few years ago, opened to a timeless admonition from the ancient prophet Micah: ""He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God."" (Micah 6:8)

This inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning, a new dedication within our Government, and a new spirit among us all. A President may sense and proclaim that new spirit, but only a people can provide it.

Two centuries ago our Nation's birth was a milestone in the long quest for freedom, but the bold and brilliant dream which excited the founders of this Nation still awaits its consummation. I have no new dream to set forth today, but rather urge a fresh faith in the old dream.

Ours was the first society openly to define itself in terms of both spirituality and of human liberty. It is that unique self-definition which has given us an exceptional appeal, but it also imposes on us a special obligation, to take on those moral duties which, when assumed, seem invariably to be in our own best interests.

You have given me a great responsibility--to stay close to you, to be worthy of you, and to exemplify what you are. Let us create together a new national spirit of unity and trust. Your strength can compensate for my weakness, and your wisdom can help to minimize my mistakes.

Let us learn together and laugh together and work together and pray together, confident that in the end we will triumph together in the right.

The American dream endures. We must once again have full faith in our country and in one another. I believe America can be better. We can be even stronger than before.

Let our recent mistakes bring a resurgent commitment to the basic principles of our Nation, for we know that if we despise our own government we have no future. We recall in special times when we have stood briefly, but magnificently, united. In those times no prize was beyond our grasp.

But we cannot dwell upon remembered glory. We cannot afford to drift. We reject the prospect of failure or mediocrity or an inferior quality of life for any person. Our Government must at the same time be both competent and compassionate.

We have already found a high degree of personal liberty, and we are now struggling to enhance equality of opportunity. Our commitment to human rights must be absolute, our laws fair, our natural beauty preserved; the powerful must not persecute the weak, and human dignity must be enhanced.

We have learned that ""more"" is not necessarily ""better,"" that even our great Nation has its recognized limits, and that we can neither answer all questions nor solve all problems. We cannot afford to do everything, nor can we afford to lack boldness as we meet the future. So, together, in a spirit of individual sacrifice for the common good, we must simply do our best.

Our Nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home. And we know that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation.

To be true to ourselves, we must be true to others. We will not behave in foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at home, for we know that the trust which our Nation earns is essential to our strength.

The world itself is now dominated by a new spirit. Peoples more numerous and more politically aware are craving and now demanding their place in the sun--not just for the benefit of their own physical condition, but for basic human rights.

The passion for freedom is on the rise. Tapping this new spirit, there can be no nobler nor more ambitious task for America to undertake on this day of a new beginning than to help shape a just and peaceful world that is truly humane.

We are a strong nation, and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it need not be proven in combat--a quiet strength based not merely on the size of an arsenal, but on the nobility of ideas.

We will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable, and we will fight our wars against poverty, ignorance, and injustice--for those are the enemies against which our forces can be honorably marshaled.

We are a purely idealistic Nation, but let no one confuse our idealism with weakness.

Because we are free we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere. Our moral sense dictates a clearcut preference for these societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights. We do not seek to intimidate, but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well-being of all people.

The world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to ensure continuing equivalent strength among potential adversaries. We pledge perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit the world's armaments to those necessary for each nation's own domestic safety. And we will move this year a step toward ultimate goal--the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this Earth. We urge all other people to join us, for success can mean life instead of death.

Within us, the people of the United States, there is evident a serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence. And I join in the hope that when my time as your President has ended, people might say this about our Nation:


	that we had remembered the words of Micah and renewed our search for humility, mercy, and justice;
	that we had torn down the barriers that separated those of different race and region and religion, and where there had been mistrust, built unity, with a respect for diversity;
	that we had found productive work for those able to perform it;
	that we had strengthened the American family, which is the basis of our society;
	that we had ensured respect for the law, and equal treatment under the law, for the weak and the powerful, for the rich and the poor;
	and that we had enabled our people to be proud of their own Government once again.


I would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace, built not on weapons of war but on international policies which reflect our own most precious values.

These are not just my goals, and they will not be my accomplishments, but the affirmation of our Nation's continuing moral strength and our belief in an undiminished, ever-expanding American dream.

the powerful must not persecute the weak, and human dignity must be enhanced. we have learned that ""more"" is not necessarily ""better,"" that even our great nation has its recognized limits, and that we can neither answer all questions nor solve all problems. we cannot afford to do everything, nor can we afford to lack boldness as we meet the future. so, together, in a spirit of individual sacrifice for the common good, we must simply do our best. our nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home. and we know that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation. to be true to ourselves, we must be true to others. we will not behave in foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at home, for we know that the trust which our nation earns is essential to our strength. the world itself is now dominated by a new spirit. peoples more numerous and more politically aware are craving and now demanding their place in the sun--not just for the benefit of their own physical condition, but for basic human rights. the passion for freedom is on the rise. tapping this new spirit, there can be no nobler nor more ambitious task for america to undertake on this day of a new beginning than to help shape a just and peaceful world that is truly humane. we are a strong nation, and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it need not be proven in combat--a quiet strength based not merely on the size of an arsenal, but on the nobility of ideas. we will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable, and we will fight our wars against poverty, ignorance, and injustice--for those are the enemies against which our forces can be honorably marshaled. we are a purely idealistic nation, but let no one confuse our idealism with weakness. because we are free we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere. our moral sense dictates a clearcut preference for these societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights. we do not seek to intimidate, but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well-being of all people. the world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to ensure continuing equivalent strength among potential adversaries. we pledge perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit the world's armaments to those necessary for each nation's own domestic safety. and we will move this year a step toward ultimate goal--the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this earth. we urge all other people to join us, for success can mean life instead of death. within us, the people of the united states, there is evident a serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence. and i join in the hope that when my time as your president has ended, people might say this about our nation:   	that we had remembered the words of micah and renewed our search for humility, mercy, and justice;  	that we had torn down the barriers that separated those of different race and region and religion, and where there had been mistrust, built unity, with a respect for diversity;  	that we had found productive work for those able to perform it;  	that we had strengthened the american family, which is the basis of our society;  	that we had ensured respect for the law, and equal treatment under the law, for the weak and the powerful, for the rich and the poor;  	and that we had enabled our people to be proud of their own government once again.   i would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace, built not on weapons of war but on international policies which reflect our own most precious values. these are not just my goals, and they will not be my accomplishments, but the affirmation of our nation's continuing moral strength and our belief in an undiminished, ever-expanding american dream.

the inner and spiritual strength of our nation.', 'as my high school teacher, miss julia coleman, used to say: ""we must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles.""', 'here before me is the bible used in the inauguration of our first president, in 1789, and i have just taken the oath of office on the bible my mother gave me a few years ago, opened to a timeless admonition from the ancient prophet micah: ""he hath showed thee, o man, what is good; and what doth the lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy god.""', '(micah 6:8) this inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning, a new dedication within our government, and a new spirit among us all.', 'a president may sense and proclaim that new spirit, but only a people can provide it.', ""two centuries ago our nation's birth was a milestone in the long quest for freedom, but the bold and brilliant dream which excited the founders of this nation still awaits its consummation."", 'i have no new dream to set forth today, but rather urge a fresh faith in the old dream.', 'ours was the first society openly to define itself in terms of both spirituality and of human liberty.', 'it is that unique self-definition which has given us an exceptional appeal, but it also imposes on us a special obligation, to take on those moral duties which, when assumed, seem invariably to be in our own best interests.', 'you have given me a great responsibility--to stay close to you, to be worthy of you, and to exemplify what you are.', 'let us create together a new national spirit of unity and trust.', 'your strength can compensate for my weakness, and your wisdom can help to minimize my mistakes.', 'let us learn together and laugh together and work together and pray together, confident that in the end we will triumph together in the right.', 'the american dream endures.', 'we must once again have full faith in our country and in one another.', 'i believe america can be better.', 'we can be even stronger than before.', 'let our recent mistakes bring a resurgent commitment to the basic principles of our nation, for we know that if we despise our own government we have no future.', 'we recall in special times when we have stood briefly, but magnificently, united.', 'in those times no prize was beyond our grasp.', 'but we cannot dwell upon remembered glory.', 'we cannot afford to drift.', 'we reject the prospect of failure or mediocrity or an inferior quality of life for any person.', 'our government must at the same time be both competent and compassionate.', 'we have already found a high degree of personal liberty, and we are now struggling to enhance equality of opportunity.', 'our commitment to human rights must be absolute, our laws fair, our natural beauty preserved; the powerful must not persecute the weak, and human dignity must be enhanced.', 'we have learned that ""more"" is not necessarily ""better,"" that even our great nation has its recognized limits, and that we can neither answer all questions nor solve all problems.', 'we cannot afford to do everything, nor can we afford to lack boldness as we meet the future.', 'so, together, in a spirit of individual sacrifice for the common good, we must simply do our best.', 'our nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home.', 'and we know that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation.', 'to be true to ourselves, we must be true to others.', 'we will not behave in foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at home, for we know that the trust which our nation earns is essential to our strength.', 'the world itself is now dominated by a new spirit.', 'peoples more numerous and more politically aware are craving and now demanding their place in the sun--not just for the benefit of their own physical condition, but for basic human rights.', 'the passion for freedom is on the rise.', 'tapping this new spirit, there can be no nobler nor more ambitious task for america to undertake on this day of a new beginning than to help shape a just and peaceful world that is truly humane.', 'we are a strong nation, and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it need not be proven in combat--a quiet strength based not merely on the size of an arsenal, but on the nobility of ideas.', 'we will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable, and we will fight our wars against poverty, ignorance, and injustice--for those are the enemies against which our forces can be honorably marshaled.', 'we are a purely idealistic nation, but let no one confuse our idealism with weakness.', 'because we are free we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere.', 'our moral sense dictates a clearcut preference for these societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights.', 'we do not seek to intimidate, but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well-being of all people.', 'the world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to ensure continuing equivalent strength among potential adversaries.', ""we pledge perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit the world's armaments to those necessary for each nation's own domestic safety."", 'and we will move this year a step toward ultimate goal--the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this earth.', 'we urge all other people to join us, for success can mean life instead of death.', 'within us, the people of the united states, there is evident a serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence.', 'and i join in the hope that when my time as your president has ended, people might say this about our nation:   \tthat we had remembered the words of micah and renewed our search for humility, mercy, and justice;  \tthat we had torn down the barriers that separated those of different race and region and religion, and where there had been mistrust, built unity, with a respect for diversity;  \tthat we had found productive work for those able to perform it;  \tthat we had strengthened the american family, which is the basis of our society;  \tthat we had ensured respect for the law, and equal treatment under the law, for the weak and the powerful, for the rich and the poor;  \tand that we had enabled our people to be proud of their own government once again.', 'i would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace, built not on weapons of war but on international policies which reflect our own most precious values.', ""these are not just my goals, and they will not be my accomplishments, but the

Richard M. Nixon,"January 20, 1973","
      
      Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Senator Cook, Mrs. Eisenhower, and my fellow citizens of this great and good country we share together:
When we met here four years ago, America was bleak in spirit, depressed by the prospect of seemingly endless war abroad and of destructive conflict at home.
As we meet here today, we stand on the threshold of a new era of peace in the world.
The central question before us is: How shall we use that peace? Let us resolve that this era we are about to enter will not be what other postwar periods have so often been: a time of retreat and isolation that leads to stagnation at home and invites new danger abroad.
Let us resolve that this will be what it can become: a time of great responsibilities greatly borne, in which we renew the spirit and the promise of America as we enter our third century as a nation.
This past year saw far-reaching results from our new policies for peace. By continuing to revitalize our traditional friendships, and by our missions to Peking and to Moscow, we were able to establish the base for a new and more durable pattern of relationships among the nations of the world. Because of America's bold initiatives, 1972 will be long remembered as the year of the greatest progress since the end of World War II toward a lasting peace in the world.
The peace we seek in the world is not the flimsy peace which is merely an interlude between wars, but a peace which can endure for generations to come.
It is important that we understand both the necessity and the limitations of America's role in maintaining that peace.
Unless we in America work to preserve the peace, there will be no peace.
Unless we in America work to preserve freedom, there will be no freedom.
But let us clearly understand the new nature of America's role, as a result of the new policies we have adopted over these past four years.
We shall respect our treaty commitments.
We shall support vigorously the principle that no country has the right to impose its will or rule on another by force.
We shall continue, in this era of negotiation, to work for the limitation of nuclear arms, and to reduce the danger of confrontation between the great powers.
We shall do our share in defending peace and freedom in the world. But we shall expect others to do their share.
The time has passed when America will make every other nation's conflict our own, or make every other nation's future our responsibility, or presume to tell the people of other nations how to manage their own affairs.
Just as we respect the right of each nation to determine its own future, we also recognize the responsibility of each nation to secure its own future.
Just as America's role is indispensable in preserving the world's peace, so is each nation's role indispensable in preserving its own peace.
Together with the rest of the world, let us resolve to move forward from the beginnings we have made. Let us continue to bring down the walls of hostility which have divided the world for too long, and to build in their place bridges of understanding--so that despite profound differences between systems of government, the people of the world can be friends.
Let us build a structure of peace in the world in which the weak are as safe as the strong--in which each respects the right of the other to live by a different system--in which those who would influence others will do so by the strength of their ideas, and not by the force of their arms.
Let us accept that high responsibility not as a burden, but gladly--gladly because the chance to build such a peace is the noblest endeavor in which a nation can engage; gladly, also, because only if we act greatly in meeting our responsibilities abroad will we remain a great Nation, and only if we remain a great Nation will we act greatly in meeting our challenges at home.
We have the chance today to do more than ever before in our history to make life better in America--to ensure better education, better health, better housing, better transportation, a cleaner environment--to restore respect for law, to make our communities more livable--and to insure the God-given right of every American to full and equal opportunity.
Because the range of our needs is so great--because the reach of our opportunities is so great--let us be bold in our determination to meet those needs in new ways.
Just as building a structure of peace abroad has required turning away from old policies that failed, so building a new era of progress at home requires turning away from old policies that have failed.
Abroad, the shift from old policies to new has not been a retreat from our responsibilities, but a better way to peace.
And at home, the shift from old policies to new will not be a retreat from our responsibilities, but a better way to progress.
Abroad and at home, the key to those new responsibilities lies in the placing and the division of responsibility. We have lived too long with the consequences of attempting to gather all power and responsibility in Washington.
Abroad and at home, the time has come to turn away from the condescending policies of paternalism--of ""Washington knows best.""
A person can be expected to act responsibly only if he has responsibility. This is human nature. So let us encourage individuals at home and nations abroad to do more for themselves, to decide more for themselves. Let us locate responsibility in more places. Let us measure what we will do for others by what they will do for themselves.
That is why today I offer no promise of a purely governmental solution for every problem. We have lived too long with that false promise. In trusting too much in government, we have asked of it more than it can deliver. This leads only to inflated expectations, to reduced individual effort, and to a disappointment and frustration that erode confidence both in what government can do and in hat people can do.
Government must learn to take less from people so that people an do more for themselves.
Let us remember that America was built not by government, but by people--not by welfare, but by work--not by shirking responsibility, but by seeking responsibility.
In our own lives, let each of us ask--not just what will government do for me, but what can I do for myself?
In the challenges we face together, let each of us ask--not just how can government help, but how can I help?
Your National Government has a great and vital role to play. And I pledge to you that where this Government should act, we will act boldly and we will lead boldly. But just as important is the role that each and every one of us must play, as an individual and as a member of his own community.
From this day forward, let each of us make a solemn commitment in his own heart: to bear his responsibility, to do his part, to live his ideals--so that together, we can see the dawn of a new age of progress for America, and together, as we celebrate our 200th anniversary as a nation, we can do so proud in the fulfillment of our promise to ourselves and to the world.
As America's longest and most difficult war comes to an end, let us again learn to debate our differences with civility and decency. And let each of us reach out for that one precious quality government cannot provide--a new level of respect for the rights and feelings of one another, a new level of respect for the individual human dignity which is the cherished birthright of every American.
Above all else, the time has come for us to renew our faith in ourselves and in America.
In recent years, that faith has been challenged.
Our children have been taught to be ashamed of their country, ashamed of their parents, ashamed of America's record at home and of its role in the world.
At every turn, we have been beset by those who find everything wrong with America and little that is right. But I am confident that this will not be the judgment of history on these remarkable times in which we are privileged to live.
America's record in this century has been unparalleled in the world's history for its responsibility, for its generosity, for its creativity and for its progress.
Let us be proud that our system has produced and provided more freedom and more abundance, more widely shared, than any other system in the history of the world.
Let us be proud that in each of the four wars in which we have been engaged in this century, including the one we are now bringing to an end, we have fought not for our selfish advantage, but to help others resist aggression.
Let us be proud that by our bold, new initiatives, and by our steadfastness for peace with honor, we have made a break-through toward creating in the world what the world has not known before--a structure of peace that can last, not merely for our time, but for generations to come.
We are embarking here today on an era that presents challenges great as those any nation, or any generation, has ever faced.
We shall answer to God, to history, and to our conscience for the way in which we use these years.
As I stand in this place, so hallowed by history, I think of others who have stood here before me. I think of the dreams they had for America, and I think of how each recognized that he needed help far beyond himself in order to make those dreams come true.
Today, I ask your prayers that in the years ahead I may have God's help in making decisions that are right for America, and I pray for your help so that together we may be worthy of our challenge.
Let us pledge together to make these next four years the best four years in America's history, so that on its 200th birthday America will be as young and as vital as when it began, and as bright a beacon of hope for all the world.
Let us go forward from here confident in hope, strong in our faith in one another, sustained by our faith in God who created us, and striving always to serve His purpose.

america's role as a result of the new policies we have adopted over these past four years  we shall respect our treaty commitments  we shall support vigorously the principle that no country has the right to impose its will or rule on another by force  we shall continue in this era of negotiation to work for the limitation of nuclear arms and to reduce the danger of confrontation between the great powers  we shall do our share in defending peace and freedom in the world but we shall expect others to do their share  the time has passed when america will make every other nation's conflict our own or make every other nation's future our responsibility or presume to tell the people of other nations how to manage their own affairs  just as we respect the right of each nation to determine its own future we also recognize the responsibility of each nation to secure its own future  just as america's role is indispensable in preserving the world's peace so is each nation's role indispensable in preserving its own peace  together with the rest of the world let us resolve to move forward from the beginnings we have made let us continue to bring down the walls of hostility which have divided the world for too long and to build in their place bridges of understanding--so that despite profound differences between systems of government the people of the world can be friends  let us build a structure of peace in the world in which the weak are as safe as the strong--in which each respects the right of the other to live by a different system--in which those who would influence others will do so by the strength of their ideas and not by the force of their arms  let us accept that high responsibility not as a burden but gladly--gladly because the chance to build such a peace is the noblest endeavor in which a nation can engage gladly also because only if we act greatly in meeting our responsibilities abroad will we remain a great nation and only if we remain a great nation will we act greatly in meeting our challenges at home  we have the chance today to do more than ever before in our history to make life better in america--to ensure better education better health better housing better transportation a cleaner environment--to restore respect for law to make our communities more livable--and to insure the god-given right of every american to full and equal opportunity  because the range of our needs is so great--because the reach of our opportunities is so great--let us be bold in our determination to meet those needs in new ways  just as building a structure of peace abroad has required turning away from old policies that failed so building a new era of progress at home requires turning away from old policies that have failed  abroad the shift from old policies to new has not been a retreat from our responsibilities but a better way to peace  and at home the shift from old policies to new will not be a retreat from our responsibilities but a better way to progress  abroad and at home the key to those new responsibilities lies in the placing and the division of responsibility we have lived too long with the consequences of attempting to gather all power and responsibility in washington  abroad and at home the time has come to turn away from the condescending policies of paternalism--of ""washington knows best""  a person can be expected to act responsibly only if he has responsibility this is human nature so let us encourage individuals at home and nations abroad to do more for themselves to decide more for themselves let us locate responsibility in more places let us measure what we will do for others by what they will do for themselves  that is why today i offer no promise of a purely governmental solution for every problem we have lived too long with that false promise in trusting too much in government we have asked of it more than it can deliver this leads only to inflated expectations to reduced individual effort and to a disappointment and frustration that erode confidence both in what government can do and in hat people can do  government must learn to take less from people so that people an do more for themselves  let us remember that america was built not by government but by people--not by welfare but by work--not by shirking responsibility but by seeking responsibility  in our own lives let each of us ask--not just what will government do for me but what can i do for myself  in the challenges we face together let each of us ask--not just how can government help but how can i help  your national government has a great and vital role to play and i pledge to you that where this government should act we will act boldly and we will lead boldly but just as important is the role that each and every one of us must play as an individual and as a member of his own community  from this day forward let each of us make a solemn commitment in his own heart to bear his responsibility to do his part to live his ideals--so that together we can see the dawn of a new age of progress for america and together as we celebrate our 200th anniversary as a nation we can do so proud in the fulfillment of our promise to ourselves and to the world  as america's longest and most difficult war comes to an end let us again learn to debate our differences with civility and decency and let each of us reach out for that one precious quality government cannot provide--a new level of respect for the rights and feelings of one another a new level of respect for the individual human dignity which is the cherished birthright of every american  above all else the time has come for us to renew our faith in ourselves and in america  in recent years that faith has been challenged  our children have been taught to be ashamed of their country ashamed of their parents ashamed of america's record at home and of its role in the world  at every turn we have been beset by those who find everything wrong with america and little that is right but i am confident that this will not be the judgment of history on these remarkable times in which we are privileged to live  america's record in this century has been unparalleled in the world's history for its responsibility for its generosity for its creativity and for its progress  let us be proud that our system has produced and provided more freedom and more abundance more widely shared than any other system in the history of the world  let us be proud that in each of the four wars in which we have been engaged in this century including the one we are now bringing to an end we have fought not for our selfish advantage but to help others resist aggression  let us be proud that by our bold new initiatives and by our steadfastness for peace with honor we have made a break-through toward creating in the world what the world has not known before--a structure of peace that can last not merely for our time but for generations to come  we are embarking here today on an era that presents challenges great as those any nation or any generation has ever faced  we shall answer to god to history and to our conscience for the way in which we use these years  as i stand in this place so hallowed by history i think of others who have stood here before me i think of the dreams they had for america and i think of how each recognized that he needed help far beyond himself in order to make those dreams come true  today i ask your prayers that in the years ahead i may have god's help in making decisions that are right for america and i pray for your help so that together we may be worthy of our challenge  let us pledge together to make these next four years the best four years in america's history so that on its 200th birthday america will be as young and as vital as when it began and as bright a beacon of hope for all the world  let us go forward from here confident in hope strong in our faith in one another sustained by our faith in god who created us and striving always to serve his purpose  ","    mr vice president mr speaker mr chief justice senator cook mrs eisenhower and my fellow citizens of this great and good country we share together  when we met here four years ago america was bleak in spirit depressed by the prospect of seemingly endless war abroad and of destructive conflict at home  as we meet here today we stand on the threshold of a new era of peace in the world  the central question before us is how shall we use that peace let us resolve that this era we are about to enter will not be what other postwar periods have so often been a time of retreat and isolation that leads to stagnation at home and invites new danger abroad  let us resolve that this will be what it can become a time of great responsibilities greatly borne in which we renew the spirit and the promise of america as we enter our third century as a nation  this past year saw far-reaching results from our new policies for peace by continuing to revitalize our traditional friendships and by our missions to peking and to moscow we were able to establish the base for a new and more durable pattern of relationships among the nations of the world because of america bold initiatives 1972 will be long remembered as the year of the greatest progress since the end of world war ii toward a lasting peace in the world  the peace we seek in the world is not the flimsy peace which is merely an interlude between wars but a peace which can endure for

vice president, mr. speaker, mr. chief justice, senator cook, mrs. eisenhower, and my fellow citizens of this great and good country we share together:  when we met here four years ago, america was bleak in spirit, depressed by the prospect of seemingly endless war abroad and of destructive conflict at home.', 'as we meet here today, we stand on the threshold of a new era of peace in the world.', 'the central question before us is: how shall we use that peace?', 'let us resolve that this era we are about to enter will not be what other postwar periods have so often been: a time of retreat and isolation that leads to stagnation at home and invites new danger abroad.', 'let us resolve that this will be what it can become: a time of great responsibilities greatly borne, in which we renew the spirit and the promise of america as we enter our third century as a nation.', 'this past year saw far-reaching results from our new policies for peace.', 'by continuing to revitalize our traditional friendships, and by our missions to peking and to moscow, we were able to establish the base for a new and more durable pattern of relationships among the nations of the world.', ""because of america's bold initiatives, 1972 will be long remembered as the year of the greatest progress since the end of world war ii toward a lasting peace in the world."", 'the peace we seek in the world is not the flimsy peace which is merely an interlude between wars, but a peace which can endure for generations to come.', ""it is important that we understand both the necessity and the limitations of america's role in maintaining that peace."", 'unless we in america work to preserve the peace, there will be no peace.', 'unless we in america work to preserve freedom, there will be no freedom.', ""but let us clearly understand the new nature of america's role, as a result of the new policies we have adopted over these past four years."", 'we shall respect our treaty commitments.', 'we shall support vigorously the principle that no country has the right to impose its will or rule on another by force.', 'we shall continue, in this era of negotiation, to work for the limitation of nuclear arms, and to reduce the danger of confrontation between the great powers.', 'we shall do our share in defending peace and freedom in the world.', 'but we shall expect others to do their share.', ""the time has passed when america will make every other nation's conflict our own, or make every other nation's future our responsibility, or presume to tell the people of other nations how to manage their own affairs."", 'just as we respect the right of each nation to determine its own future, we also recognize the responsibility of each nation to secure its own future.', ""just as america's role is indispensable in preserving the world's peace, so is each nation's role indispensable in preserving its own peace."", 'together with the rest of the world, let us resolve to move forward from the beginnings we have made.', 'let us continue to bring down the walls of hostility which have divided the world for too long, and to build in their place bridges of understanding--so that despite profound differences between systems of government, the people of the world can be friends.', 'let us build a structure of peace in the world in which the weak are as safe as the strong--in which each respects the right of the other to live by a different system--in which those who would influence others will do so by the strength of their ideas, and not by the force of their arms.', 'let us accept that high responsibility not as a burden, but gladly--gladly because the chance to build such a peace is the noblest endeavor in which a nation can engage; gladly, also, because only if we act greatly in meeting our responsibilities abroad will we remain a great nation, and only if we remain a great nation will we act greatly in meeting our challenges at home.', 'we have the chance today to do more than ever before in our history to make life better in america--to ensure better education, better health, better housing, better transportation, a cleaner environment--to restore respect for law, to make our communities more livable--and to insure the god-given right of every american to full and equal opportunity.', 'because the range of our needs is so great--because the reach of our opportunities is so great--let us be bold in our determination to meet those needs in new ways.', 'just as building a structure of peace abroad has required turning away from old policies that failed, so building a new era of progress at home requires turning away from old policies that have failed.', 'abroad, the shift from old policies to new has not been a retreat from our responsibilities, but a better way to peace.', 'and at home, the shift from old policies to new will not be a retreat from our responsibilities, but a better way to progress.', 'abroad and at home, the key to those new responsibilities lies in the placing and the division of responsibility.', 'we have lived too long with the consequences of attempting to gather all power and responsibility in washington.', 'abroad and at home, the time has come to turn away from the condescending policies of paternalism--of ""washington knows best.""', 'a person can be expected to act responsibly only if he has responsibility.', 'this is human nature.', 'so let us encourage individuals at home and nations abroad to do more for themselves, to decide more for themselves.', 'let us locate responsibility in more places.', 'let us measure what we will do for others by what they will do for themselves.', 'that is why today i offer no promise of a purely governmental solution for every problem.', 'we have lived too long with that false promise.', 'in trusting too much in government, we have asked of it more than it can deliver.', 'this leads only to inflated expectations, to reduced individual effort, and to a disappointment and frustration that erode confidence both in what government can do and in hat people can do.', 'government must learn to take less from people so that people an do more for themselves.', 'let us remember that america was built not by government, but by people--not by welfare, but by work--not by shirking responsibility, but by seeking responsibility.', 'in our own lives, let each of us ask--not just what will government do for me, but what can i do for myself?', 'in the challenges we face together, let each of us ask--not just how can government help, but how can i help?', 'your national government has a great and vital role to play.', 'and i pledge to you that where this government should act, we will act boldly and we will lead boldly.', 'but just as important is the role that each and every one of us must play, as an individual and as a member of his own community.', 'from this day forward, let each of us make a solemn commitment in his own heart: to bear his responsibility, to do his part, to live his ideals--so that together, we can see the dawn of a new age of progress for america, and together, as we celebrate our 200th anniversary as a nation, we can do so proud in the fulfillment of our promise to ourselves and to the world.', ""as america's longest and most difficult war comes to an end, let us again learn to debate our differences with civility and decency."", 'and let each of us reach out for that one precious quality government cannot provide--a new level of respect for the rights and feelings of one another, a new level of respect for the individual human dignity which is the cherished birthright of every american.', 'above all else, the time has come for us to renew our faith in ourselves and in america.', 'in recent years, that faith has been challenged.', ""our children have been taught to be ashamed of their country, ashamed of their parents, ashamed of america's record at home and of its role in the world."", 'at every turn, we have been beset by those who find everything wrong with america and little that is right.', 'but i am confident that this will not be the judgment of history on these remarkable times in which we are privileged to live.', ""america's record in this century has been unparalleled in the world's history for its responsibility, for its generosity, for its creativity and for its progress."", 'let us be proud that our system has produced and provided more freedom and more abundance, more widely shared, than any other system in the history of the world.', 'let us be proud that in each of the four wars in which we have been engaged in this century, including the one we are now bringing to an end, we have fought not for our selfish advantage, but to help others resist aggression.', 'let us be proud that by our bold, new initiatives, and by our steadfastness for peace with honor, we have made a break-through toward creating in the world what the world has not known before--a structure of peace that can last, not merely for our time, but for generations to come.', 'we are embarking here today on an era that presents challenges great as those any nation, or any generation, has ever faced.', 'we shall answer to god, to history, and to our conscience for the way in which we use these years.', 'as i stand in this place, so hallowed by history, i think of others who have stood here before me.', 'i think of the dreams they had for america, and i think of how each recognized that he needed help far beyond himself in order to make those dreams come true.', ""today, i ask your prayers that in the years ahead i may have god's help in making decisions that are right for america, and i pray for your help so that together we may be worthy of our challenge."", ""let us pledge together to make these next four years the best four years in america's history, so that on its 200th birthday america will be as young and as vital as when it began, and as bright a beacon of hope for all the world."", 'let us go forward from here confident in hope, strong in our faith in one another, sustained by our faith in god who created us, and striving always to serve his purpose.']","['chief', 'justice', 'senator', 'cook', 'mrs', 'eisenhower', 'fellow', 'citizens', 'great', 'good', 'country', 'share', 'together', 'meet', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'america',

Richard M. Nixon,"January 20, 1969","
      
      Senator Dirksen, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, President Johnson, Vice President Humphrey, my fellow Americans--and my fellow citizens of the world community:
I ask you to share with me today the majesty of this moment. In the orderly transfer of power, we celebrate the unity that keeps us free.
Each moment in history is a fleeting time, precious and unique. But some stand out as moments of beginning, in which courses are set that shape decades or centuries.
This can be such a moment.
Forces now are converging that make possible, for the first time, the hope that many of man's deepest aspirations can at last be realized. The spiraling pace of change allows us to contemplate, within our own lifetime, advances that once would have taken centuries.
In throwing wide the horizons of space, we have discovered new horizons on earth.
For the first time, because the people of the world want peace, and the leaders of the world are afraid of war, the times are on the side of peace.
Eight years from now America will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a nation. Within the lifetime of most people now living, mankind will celebrate that great new year which comes only once in a thousand years--the beginning of the third millennium.
What kind of nation we will be, what kind of world we will live in, whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes, is ours to determine by our actions and our choices.
The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker. This honor now beckons America--the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil, and onto that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization.
If we succeed, generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moment, that we helped make the world safe for mankind.
This is our summons to greatness.
I believe the American people are ready to answer this call.
The second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement. We have made enormous strides in science and industry and agriculture. We have shared our wealth more broadly than ever. We have learned at last to manage a modern economy to assure its continued growth.
We have given freedom new reach, and we have begun to make its promise real for black as well as for white.
We see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today. I know America's youth. I believe in them. We can be proud that they are better educated, more committed, more passionately driven by conscience than any generation in our history.
No people has ever been so close to the achievement of a just and abundant society, or so possessed of the will to achieve it. Because our strengths are so great, we can afford to appraise our weaknesses with candor and to approach them with hope.
Standing in this same place a third of a century ago, Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed a Nation ravaged by depression and gripped in fear. He could say in surveying the Nation's troubles: ""They concern, thank God, only material things.""
Our crisis today is the reverse.
We have found ourselves rich in goods, but ragged in spirit; reaching with magnificent precision for the moon, but falling into raucous discord on earth.
We are caught in war, wanting peace. We are torn by division, wanting unity. We see around us empty lives, wanting fulfillment. We see tasks that need doing, waiting for hands to do them.
To a crisis of the spirit, we need an answer of the spirit.
To find that answer, we need only look within ourselves.
When we listen to ""the better angels of our nature,"" we find that they celebrate the simple things, the basic things--such as goodness, decency, love, kindness.
Greatness comes in simple trappings.
The simple things are the ones most needed today if we are to surmount what divides us, and cement what unites us.
To lower our voices would be a simple thing.
In these difficult years, America has suffered from a fever of words; from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver; from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds; from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading.
We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another--until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices.
For its part, government will listen. We will strive to listen in new ways--to the voices of quiet anguish, the voices that speak without words, the voices of the heart--to the injured voices, the anxious voices, the voices that have despaired of being heard.
Those who have been left out, we will try to bring in.
Those left behind, we will help to catch up.
For all of our people, we will set as our goal the decent order that makes progress possible and our lives secure.
As we reach toward our hopes, our task is to build on what has gone before--not turning away from the old, but turning toward the new.
In this past third of a century, government has passed more laws, spent more money, initiated more programs, than in all our previous history.
In pursuing our goals of full employment, better housing, excellence in education; in rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas; in protecting our environment and enhancing the quality of life--in all these and more, we will and must press urgently forward.
We shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transferred from the destruction of war abroad to the urgent needs of our people at home.
The American dream does not come to those who fall asleep.
But we are approaching the limits of what government alone can do.
Our greatest need now is to reach beyond government, and to enlist the legions of the concerned and the committed.
What has to be done, has to be done by government and people together or it will not be done at all. The lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do nothing; with the people we can do everything.
To match the magnitude of our tasks, we need the energies of our people--enlisted not only in grand enterprises, but more importantly in those small, splendid efforts that make headlines in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal.
With these, we can build a great cathedral of the spirit--each of us raising it one stone at a time, as he reaches out to his neighbor, helping, caring, doing.
I do not offer a life of uninspiring ease. I do not call for a life of grim sacrifice. I ask you to join in a high adventure--one as rich as humanity itself, and as exciting as the times we live in.
The essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of his own destiny.
Until he has been part of a cause larger than himself, no man is truly whole.
The way to fulfillment is in the use of our talents; we achieve nobility in the spirit that inspires that use.
As we measure what can be done, we shall promise only what we know we can produce, but as we chart our goals we shall be lifted by our dreams.
No man can be fully free while his neighbor is not. To go forward at all is to go forward together.
This means black and white together, as one nation, not two. The laws have caught up with our conscience. What remains is to give life to what is in the law: to ensure at last that as all are born equal in dignity before God, all are born equal in dignity before man.
As we learn to go forward together at home, let us also seek to go forward together with all mankind.
Let us take as our goal: where peace is unknown, make it welcome; where peace is fragile, make it strong; where peace is temporary, make it permanent.
After a period of confrontation, we are entering an era of negotiation.
Let all nations know that during this administration our lines of communication will be open.
We seek an open world--open to ideas, open to the exchange of goods and people--a world in which no people, great or small, will live in angry isolation.
We cannot expect to make everyone our friend, but we can try to make no one our enemy.
Those who would be our adversaries, we invite to a peaceful competition--not in conquering territory or extending dominion, but in enriching the life of man.
As we explore the reaches of space, let us go to the new worlds together--not as new worlds to be conquered, but as a new adventure to be shared.
With those who are willing to join, let us cooperate to reduce the burden of arms, to strengthen the structure of peace, to lift up the poor and the hungry.
But to all those who would be tempted by weakness, let us leave no doubt that we will be as strong as we need to be for as long as we need to be.
Over the past twenty years, since I first came to this Capital as a freshman Congressman, I have visited most of the nations of the world.
I have come to know the leaders of the world, and the great forces, the hatreds, the fears that divide the world.
I know that peace does not come through wishing for it--that there is no substitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy.
I also know the people of the world.
I have seen the hunger of a homeless child, the pain of a man wounded in battle, the grief of a mother who has lost her son. I know these have no ideology, no race.
I know America. I know the heart of America is good.
I speak from my own heart, and the heart of my country, the deep concern we have for those who suffer, and those who sorrow.
I have taken an oath today in the presence of God and my countrymen to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. To that oath I now add this sacred commitment: I shall consecrate my office, my energies, and all the wisdom I can summon, to the cause of peace among nations.
Let this message be heard by strong and weak alike:
The peace we seek to win is not victory over any other people, but the peace that comes ""with healing in its wings""; with compassion for those who have suffered; with understanding for those who have opposed us; with the opportunity for all the peoples of this earth to choose their own destiny.
Only a few short weeks ago, we shared the glory of man's first sight of the world as God sees it, as a single sphere reflecting light in the darkness.
As the Apollo astronauts flew over the moon's gray surface on Christmas Eve, they spoke to us of the beauty of earth--and in that voice so clear across the lunar distance, we heard them invoke God's blessing on its goodness.
In that moment, their view from the moon moved poet Archibald MacLeish to write:
""To see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold--brothers who know now they are truly brothers.""
In that moment of surpassing technological triumph, men turned their thoughts toward home and humanity--seeing in that far perspective that man's destiny on earth is not divisible; telling us that however far we reach into the cosmos, our destiny lies not in the stars but on Earth itself, in our own hands, in our own hearts.
We have endured a long night of the American spirit. But as our eyes catch the dimness of the first rays of dawn, let us not curse the remaining dark. Let us gather the light.
Our destiny offers, not the cup of despair, but the chalice of opportunity. So let us seize it, not in fear, but in gladness-- and, ""riders on the earth together,"" let us go forward, firm in our faith, steadfast in our purpose, cautious of the dangers; but sustained by our confidence in the will of God and the promise of man.

    ",Inaugural Address,Republican,1,1969,"    Senator Dirksen, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, President Johnson, Vice President Humphrey, my fellow Americans--and my fellow citizens of the world community:  I ask you to share with me today the majesty of this moment. In the orderly transfer of power, we celebrate the unity that keeps us free.  Each moment in history is a fleeting time, precious and unique. But some stand out as moments of beginning, in which courses are set that shape decades or centuries.  This can be such a moment.  Forces now are converging that make possible, for the first time, the hope that many of man's deepest aspirations can at last be realized. The spiraling pace of change allows us to contemplate, within our own lifetime, advances that once would have taken centuries.  In throwing wide the horizons of space, we have discovered new horizons on earth.  For the first time, because the people of the world want peace, and the leaders of the world are afraid of war, the times are on the side of peace.  Eight years from now America will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a nation. Within the lifetime of most people now living, mankind will celebrate that great new year which comes only once in a thousand years--the beginning of the third millennium.  What kind of nation we will be, what kind of world we will live in, whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes, is ours to determine by our actions and our choices.  The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker. This honor now beckons America--the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil, and onto that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization.  If we succeed, generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moment, that we helped make the world safe for mankind.  This is our summons to greatness.  I believe the American people are ready to answer this call.  The second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement. We have made enormous strides in science and industry and agriculture. We have shared our wealth more broadly than ever. We have learned at last to manage a modern economy to assure its continued growth.  We have given freedom new reach, and we have begun to make its promise real for black as well as for white.  We see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today. I know America's youth. I believe in them. We can be proud that they are better educated, more committed, more passionately driven by conscience than any generation in our history.  No people has ever been so close to the achievement of a just and abundant society, or so possessed of the will to achieve it. Because our strengths are so great, we can afford to appraise our weaknesses with candor and to approach them with hope.  Standing in this same place a third of a century ago, Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed a Nation ravaged by depression and gripped in fear. He could say in surveying the Nation's troubles: ""They concern, thank God, only material things.""  Our crisis today is the reverse.  We have found ourselves rich in goods, but ragged in spirit; reaching with magnificent precision for the moon, but falling into raucous discord on earth.  We are caught in war, wanting peace. We are torn by division, wanting unity. We see around us empty lives, wanting fulfillment. We see tasks that need doing, waiting for hands to do them.  To a crisis of the spirit, we need an answer of the spirit.  To find that answer, we need only look within ourselves.  When we listen to ""the better angels of our nature,"" we find that they celebrate the simple things, the basic things--such as goodness, decency, love, kindness.  Greatness comes in simple trappings.  The simple things are the ones most needed today if we are to surmount what divides us, and cement what unites us.  To lower our voices would be a simple thing.  In these difficult years, America has suffered from a fever of words; from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver; from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds; from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading.  We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another--until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices.  For its part, government will listen. We will strive to listen in new ways--to the voices of quiet anguish, the voices that speak without words, the voices of the heart--to the injured voices, the anxious voices, the voices that have despaired of being heard.  Those who have been left out, we will try to bring in.  Those left behind, we will help to catch up.  For all of our people, we will set as our goal the decent order that makes progress possible and our lives secure.  As we reach toward our hopes, our task is to build on what has gone before--not turning away from the old, but turning toward the new.  In this past third of a century, government has passed more laws, spent more money, initiated more programs, than in all our previous history.  In pursuing our goals of full employment, better housing, excellence in education; in rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas; in protecting our environment and enhancing the quality of life--in all these and more, we will and must press urgently forward.  We shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transferred from the destruction of war abroad to the urgent needs of our people at home.  The American dream does not come to those who fall asleep.  But we are approaching the limits of what government alone can do.  Our greatest need now is to reach beyond government, and to enlist the legions of the concerned and the committed.  What has to be done, has to be done by government and people together or it will not be done at all. The lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do nothing; with the people we can do everything.  To match the magnitude of our tasks, we need the energies of our people--enlisted not only in grand enterprises, but more importantly in those small, splendid efforts that make headlines in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal.  With these, we can build a great cathedral of the spirit--each of us raising it one stone at a time, as he reaches out to his neighbor, helping, caring, doing.  I do not offer a life of uninspiring ease. I do not call for a life of grim sacrifice. I ask you to join in a high adventure--one as rich as humanity itself, and as exciting as the times we live in.  The essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of his own destiny.  Until he has been part of a cause larger than himself, no man is truly whole.  The way to fulfillment is in the use of our talents; we achieve nobility in the spirit that inspires that use.  As we measure what can be done, we shall promise only what we know we can produce, but as we chart our goals we shall be lifted by our dreams.  No man can be fully free while his neighbor is not. To go forward at all is to go forward together.  This means black and white together, as one nation, not two. The laws have caught up with our conscience. What remains is to give life to what is in the law: to ensure at last that as all are born equal in dignity before God, all are born equal in dignity before man.

come through wishing for it--that there is no substitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy  i also know the people of the world  i have seen the hunger of a homeless child the pain of a man wounded in battle the grief of a mother who has lost her son i know these have no ideology no race  i know america i know the heart of america is good  i speak from my own heart and the heart of my country the deep concern we have for those who suffer and those who sorrow  i have taken an oath today in the presence of god and my countrymen to uphold and defend the constitution of the united states to that oath i now add this sacred commitment i shall consecrate my office my energies and all the wisdom i can summon to the cause of peace among nations  let this message be heard by strong and weak alike  the peace we seek to win is not victory over any other people but the peace that comes ""with healing in its wings"" with compassion for those who have suffered with understanding for those who have opposed us with the opportunity for all the peoples of this earth to choose their own destiny  only a few short weeks ago we shared the glory of man's first sight of the world as god sees it as a single sphere reflecting light in the darkness  as the apollo astronauts flew over the moon's gray surface on christmas eve they spoke to us of the beauty of earth--and in that voice so clear across the lunar distance we heard them invoke god's blessing on its goodness  in that moment their view from the moon moved poet archibald macleish to write  ""to see the earth as it truly is small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold--brothers who know now they are truly brothers""  in that moment of surpassing technological triumph men turned their thoughts toward home and humanity--seeing in that far perspective that man's destiny on earth is not divisible telling us that however far we reach into the cosmos our destiny lies not in the stars but on earth itself in our own hands in our own hearts  we have endured a long night of the american spirit but as our eyes catch the dimness of the first rays of dawn let us not curse the remaining dark let us gather the light  our destiny offers not the cup of despair but the chalice of opportunity so let us seize it not in fear but in gladness-- and ""riders on the earth together"" let us go forward firm in our faith steadfast in our purpose cautious of the dangers but sustained by our confidence in the will of god and the promise of man  ","    senator dirksen mr chief justice mr vice president president johnson vice president humphrey my fellow americans--and my fellow citizens of the world community  i ask you to share with me today the majesty of this moment in the orderly transfer of power we celebrate the unity that keeps us free  each moment in history is a fleeting time precious and unique but some stand out as moments of beginning in which courses are set that shape decades or centuries  this can be such a moment  forces now are converging that make possible for the first time the hope that many of man deepest aspirations can at last be realized the spiraling pace of change allows us to contemplate within our own lifetime advances that once would have taken centuries  in throwing wide the horizons of space we have discovered new horizons on earth  for the first time because the people of the world want peace and the leaders of the world are afraid of war the times are on the side of peace  eight years from now america will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a nation within the lifetime of most people now living mankind will celebrate that great new year which comes only once in a thousand years--the beginning of the third millennium  what kind of nation we will be what kind of world we will live in whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes is ours to determine by our actions and our choices  the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker this honor now beckons america--the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil and onto that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization  if we succeed generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moment that we helped make the world safe for mankind  this is our summons to greatness  i believe the american people are ready to answer this call  the second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement we have made enormous strides in science and industry and agriculture we have shared our wealth more broadly than ever we have learned at last to manage a modern economy to assure its continued growth  we have given freedom new reach and we have begun to make its promise real for black as well as for white  we see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today i know america youth i believe in them we can be proud that they are better educated more committed more passionately driven by conscience than any generation in our history  no people has ever been so close to the achievement of a just and abundant society or so possessed of the will to achieve it because our strengths are so great we can afford to appraise our weaknesses with candor and to approach them with hope  standing in this same place a third of a century ago franklin delano roosevelt addressed a nation ravaged by depression and gripped in fear he could say in surveying the nation troubles ""they concern thank god only material things""  our crisis today is the reverse  we have found ourselves rich in goods but ragged in spirit reaching with magnificent precision for the moon but falling into raucous discord on earth  we are caught in war wanting peace we are torn by division wanting unity we see around us empty lives wanting fulfillment we see tasks that need doing waiting for hands to do them  to a crisis of the spirit we need an answer of the spirit  to find that answer we need only look within ourselves  when we listen to ""the better angels of our nature"" we find that they celebrate the simple things the basic things--such as goodness decency love kindness  greatness comes in simple trappings  the simple things are the ones most needed today if we are to surmount what divides us and cement what unites us  to lower our voices would be a simple thing  in these difficult years america has suffered from a fever of words from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading  we cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another--until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices  for its part government will listen we will strive to listen in new ways--to the voices of quiet anguish the voices that speak without words the voices of the heart--to the injured voices the anxious voices the voices that have despaired of being heard  those who have been left out we will try to bring in  those left behind we will help to catch up  for all of our people we will set as our goal the decent order that makes progress possible and our lives secure  as we reach toward our hopes our task is to build on what has gone before--not turning away from the old but turning toward the new  in this past third of a century government has passed more laws spent more money initiated more programs than in all our previous history  in pursuing our goals of full employment better housing excellence in education in rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas in protecting our environment and enhancing the quality of life--in all these and more we will and must press urgently forward  we shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transferred from the destruction of war abroad to the urgent needs of our people at home  the american dream does not come to those who fall asleep  but we are approaching the limits of what government alone can do  our greatest need now is to reach beyond government and to enlist the legions of the concerned and the committed  what has to be done has to be done by government and people together or it will not be done at all the lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do nothing with the people we can do everything  to match the magnitude of our tasks we need the energies of our people--enlisted not only in grand enterprises but more importantly in those small splendid efforts that make headlines in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal  with these we can build a great cathedral of the spirit--each of us raising it one stone at a time as he reaches out to his neighbor helping caring doing  i do not offer a life of uninspiring ease i do not call for a life of grim sacrifice i ask you to join in a high adventure--one as rich as humanity itself and as exciting as the times we live in  the essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of his own destiny  until he has been part of a cause larger than himself no man is truly whole  the way to fulfillment is in the use of our talents we achieve nobility in the spirit that inspires that use  as we measure what can be done we shall promise only what we know we can produce but as we chart our goals we shall be lifted by our dreams  no man can be fully free while his neighbor is not to go forward at all is to go forward together  this means black and white together as one nation not two the laws have caught up with our conscience what remains is to give life to what is in the law to ensure at last that as all are born equal in dignity before god all are born equal in dignity before man  as we learn to go forward together at home let us also seek to go forward together with all mankind  let us take as our goal where peace is unknown make it welcome where peace is fragile make it strong where peace is temporary make it permanent  after a period of confrontation we are entering an era of negotiation  let all nations know that during this administration our lines of communication will be open  we seek an open world--open to ideas open to the exchange of goods and people--a world in which no people great or small will live in angry isolation  we cannot expect to make everyone our friend but we can try to make no one our enemy  those who would be our adversaries we invite to a peaceful competition--not in conquering territory or extending dominion but in enriching the life of man  as we explore the reaches of space let us go to the new worlds together--not as new worlds to be conquered but as a new adventure to be shared  with those who are willing to join let us cooperate to reduce the burden of arms to strengthen the structure of peace to lift up the poor and the hungry  but to all those who would be tempted by weakness let us leave no doubt that we will be as strong as we need to be for as long as we need to be  over the past twenty years since i first came to this

nation.', 'within the lifetime of most people now living, mankind will celebrate that great new year which comes only once in a thousand years--the beginning of the third millennium.', 'what kind of nation we will be, what kind of world we will live in, whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes, is ours to determine by our actions and our choices.', 'the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker.', 'this honor now beckons america--the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil, and onto that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization.', 'if we succeed, generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moment, that we helped make the world safe for mankind.', 'this is our summons to greatness.', 'i believe the american people are ready to answer this call.', 'the second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement.', 'we have made enormous strides in science and industry and agriculture.', 'we have shared our wealth more broadly than ever.', 'we have learned at last to manage a modern economy to assure its continued growth.', 'we have given freedom new reach,

conquered, but as a new adventure to be shared.', 'with those who are willing to join, let us cooperate to reduce the burden of arms, to strengthen the structure of peace, to lift up the poor and the

astronauts flew over the moon's gray surface on christmas eve, they spoke to us of the beauty of earth--and in that voice so clear across the lunar distance, we heard them invoke god's blessing on its goodness."", 'in that moment, their view from the moon moved poet archibald macleish to write:  ""to see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold--brothers who know now they are truly brothers.""', ""in that moment of surpassing technological triumph, men turned their thoughts toward home and humanity--seeing in that far perspective that man's destiny on earth is not divisible; telling us that however far we reach into the cosmos, our destiny lies not in the stars but on earth itself, in our own hands, in our own hearts."", 'we have endured a long night of the american spirit.', 'but as our eyes catch the dimness of the first rays of dawn, let us not curse the remaining dark.', 'let us gather the light.', 'our destiny offers, not the cup of despair, but the chalice of opportunity.', 'so let us seize it, not in fear, but in gladness-- and, ""riders on the earth together,"" let us go forward, firm in our faith, steadfast in our purpose, cautious of the dangers; but sustained by our confidence in the will of god and

Lyndon B. Johnson,"January 20, 1965","
      
      My fellow countrymen:
On this occasion the oath I have taken before you and before God is not mine alone, but ours together. We are one nation and one people. Our fate as a nation and our future as a people rest not upon one citizen but upon all citizens.
That is the majesty and the meaning of this moment.
For every generation there is a destiny. For some, history decides. For this generation the choice must be our own.
Even now, a rocket moves toward Mars. It reminds us that the world will not be the same for our children, or even for ourselves in a short span of years. The next man to stand here will look out on a scene that is different from our own.
Ours is a time of change—rapid and fantastic change—bearing the secrets of nature, multiplying the nations, placing in uncertain hands new weapons for mastery and destruction, shaking old values and uprooting old ways.
Our destiny in the midst of change will rest on the unchanged character of our people and on their faith.
They came here—the exile and the stranger, brave but frightened—to find a place where a man could be his own man. They made a covenant with this land. Conceived in justice, written in liberty, bound in union, it was meant one day to inspire the hopes of all mankind. And it binds us still. If we keep its terms we shall flourish.
First, justice was the promise that all who made the journey would share in the fruits of the land.
In a land of great wealth, families must not live in hopeless poverty. In a land rich in harvest, children just must not go hungry. In a land of healing miracles, neighbors must not suffer and die untended. In a great land of learning and scholars, young people must be taught to read and write.
For more than 30 years that I have served this Nation I have believed that this injustice to our people, this waste of our resources, was our real enemy. For 30 years or more, with the resources I have had, I have vigilantly fought against it. I have learned and I know that it will not surrender easily.
But change has given us new weapons. Before this generation of Americans is finished, this enemy will not only retreat, it will be conquered.
Justice requires us to remember: when any citizen denies his fellow, saying: ""His color is not mine or his beliefs are strange and different,"" in that moment he betrays America, though his forebears created this Nation.
Liberty was the second article of our covenant. It was self-government. It was our Bill of Rights. But it was more. America would be a place where each man could be proud to be himself: stretching his talents, rejoicing in his work, important in the life of his neighbors and his nation.
This has become more difficult in a world where change and growth seem to tower beyond the control and even the judgment of men. We must work to provide the knowledge and the surroundings which can enlarge the possibilities of every citizen.
The American covenant called on us to help show the way for the liberation of man. And that is today our goal. Thus, if as a nation, there is much outside our control, as a people no stranger is outside our hope.
Change has brought new meaning to that old mission. We can never again stand aside, prideful in isolation. Terrific dangers and troubles that we once called ""foreign"" now constantly live among us. If American lives must end, and American treasure be spilled, in countries that we barely know, then that is the price that change has demanded of conviction and of our enduring covenant.
Think of our world as it looks from that rocket that is heading toward Mars. It is like a child's globe, hanging in space, the continent stuck to its side like colored maps. We are all fellow passengers on a dot of earth. And each of us, in the span of time, has really only a moment among our companions.
How incredible it is that in this fragile existence we should hate and destroy one another. There are possibilities enough for all who will abandon mastery over others to pursue mastery over nature. There is world enough for all to seek their happiness in their own way.
Our Nation's course is abundantly clear. We aspire to nothing that belongs to others. We seek no dominion over our fellow man, but man's dominion over tyranny and misery.
But more is required. Men want to be part of a common enterprise, a cause greater than themselves. And each of us must find a way to advance the purpose of the Nation, thus finding new purpose for ourselves. Without this, we will simply become a nation of strangers.
The third article is union. To those who were small and few against the wilderness, the success of liberty demanded the strength of union. Two centuries of change have made this true again.
No longer need capitalist and worker, farmer and clerk, city and countryside, struggle to divide our bounty. By working shoulder to shoulder together we can increase the bounty of all. We have discovered that every child who learns, and every man who finds work, and every sick body that is made whole—like a candle added to an altar—brightens the hope of all the faithful.
So let us reject any among us who seek to reopen old wounds and rekindle old hatreds. They stand in the way of a seeking nation.
Let us now join reason to faith and action to experience, to transform our unity of interest into a unity of purpose. For the hour and the day and the time are here to achieve progress without strife, to achieve change without hatred; not without difference of opinion but without the deep and abiding divisions which scar the union for generations.
Under this covenant of justice, liberty, and union we have become a nation—prosperous, great, and mighty. And we have kept our freedom. But we have no promise from God that our greatness will endure. We have been allowed by Him to seek greatness with the sweat of our hands and the strength of our spirit.
I do not believe that the Great Society is the ordered, changeless, and sterile battalion of the ants. It is the excitement of becoming—always becoming, trying, probing, falling, resting, and trying again—but always trying and always gaining.
In each generation, with toil and tears, we have had to earn our heritage again. If we fail now then we will have forgotten in abundance what we learned in hardship: that democracy rests on faith, that freedom asks more than it gives, and the judgment of God is harshest on those who are most favored.
If we succeed it will not be because of what we have, but it will be because of what we are; not because of what we own, but rather because of what we believe.
For we are a nation of believers. Underneath the clamor of building and the rush of our day's pursuits, we are believers in justice and liberty and in our own union. We believe that every man must some day be free. And we believe in ourselves.
And that is the mistake that our enemies have always made. In my lifetime, in depression and in war they have awaited our defeat. Each time, from the secret places of the American heart, came forth the faith that they could not see or that they could not even imagine. And it brought us victory. And it will again.
For this is what America is all about. It is the uncrossed desert and the unclimbed ridge. It is the star that is not reached and the harvest that is sleeping in the unplowed ground. Is our world gone? We say farewell. Is a new world coming? We welcome it, and we will bend it to the hopes of man.
And to these trusted public servants and to my family, and those close friends of mine who have followed me down a long winding road, and to all the people of this Union and the world, I will repeat today what I said on that sorrowful day in November last year: I will lead and I will do the best I can.
But you, you must look within your own hearts to the old promises and to the old dreams. They will lead you best of all.
For myself, I ask only in the words of an ancient leader: ""Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?""

difference of opinion but without the deep and abiding divisions which scar the union for generations  under this covenant of justice liberty and union we have become a nation—prosperous great and mighty and we have kept our freedom but we have no promise from god that our greatness will endure we have been allowed by him to seek greatness with the sweat of our hands and the strength of our spirit  i do not believe that the great society is the ordered changeless and sterile battalion of the ants it is the excitement of becoming—always becoming trying probing falling resting and trying again—but always trying and always gaining  in each generation with toil and tears we have had to earn our heritage again if we fail now then we will have forgotten in abundance what we learned in hardship that democracy rests on faith that freedom asks more than it gives and the judgment of god is harshest on those who are most favored  if we succeed it will not be because of what we have but it will be because of what we are not because of what we own but rather because of what we believe  for we are a nation of believers underneath the clamor of building and the rush of our day's pursuits we are believers in justice and liberty and in our own union we believe that every man must some day be free and we believe in ourselves  and that is the mistake that our enemies have always made in my lifetime in depression and in war they have awaited our defeat each time from the secret places of the american heart came forth the faith that they could not see or that they could not even imagine and it brought us victory and it will again  for this is what america is all about it is the uncrossed desert and the unclimbed ridge it is the star that is not reached and the harvest that is sleeping in the unplowed ground is our world gone we say farewell is a new world coming we welcome it and we will bend it to the hopes of man  and to these trusted public servants and to my family and those close friends of mine who have followed me down a long winding road and to all the people of this union and the world i will repeat today what i said on that sorrowful day in november last year i will lead and i will do the best i can  but you you must look within your own hearts to the old promises and to the old dreams they will lead you best of all  for myself i ask only in the words of an ancient leader ""give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this thy people that is so great""  ","    my fellow countrymen  on this occasion the oath i have taken before you and before god is not mine alone but ours together we are one nation and one people our fate as a nation and our future as a people rest not upon one citizen but upon all citizens  that is the majesty and the meaning of this moment  for every generation there is a destiny for some history decides for this generation the choice must be our own  even now a rocket moves toward mars it reminds us that the world will not be the same for our children or even for ourselves in a short span of years the next man to stand here will look out on a scene that is different from our own  ours is a time of change—rapid and fantastic change—bearing the secrets of nature multiplying the nations placing in uncertain hands new weapons for mastery and destruction shaking old values and uprooting old ways  our destiny in the midst of change will rest on the unchanged character of our people and on their faith  they came here—the exile and the stranger brave but frightened—to find a place where a man could be his own man they made a covenant with this land conceived in justice written in liberty bound in union it was meant one day to inspire the hopes of all mankind and it binds us still if we keep its terms we shall flourish  first justice was the promise that all who made the journey would share in the fruits of the land  in a land of great wealth families must not live in hopeless poverty in a land rich in harvest children just must not go hungry in a land of healing miracles neighbors must not suffer and die untended in a great land of learning and scholars young people must be taught to read and write  for more than 30 years that i have served this nation i have believed that this injustice to our people this waste of our resources was our real enemy for 30 years or more with the resources i have had i have vigilantly fought against it i have learned and i know that it will not surrender easily  but change has given us new weapons before this generation of americans is finished this enemy will not only retreat it will be conquered  justice requires us to remember when any citizen denies his fellow saying ""his color is not mine or his beliefs are strange and different"" in that moment he betrays america though his forebears created this nation  liberty was the second article of our covenant it was self-government it was our bill of rights but it was more america would be a place where each man could be proud to be himself stretching his talents rejoicing in his work important in the life of his neighbors and his nation  this has become more difficult in a world where change and growth seem to tower beyond the control and even the judgment of men we must work to provide the knowledge and the surroundings which can enlarge the possibilities of every citizen  the american covenant called on us to help show the way for the liberation of man and that is today our goal thus if as a nation there is much outside our control as a people no stranger is outside our hope  change has brought new meaning to that old mission we can never again stand aside prideful in isolation terrific dangers and troubles that we once called ""foreign"" now constantly live among us if american lives must end and american treasure be spilled in countries that we barely know then that is the price that change has demanded of conviction and of our enduring covenant  think of our world as it looks from that rocket that is heading toward mars it is like a child globe hanging in space the continent stuck to its side like colored maps we are all fellow passengers on a dot of earth and each of us in the span of time has really only a moment among our companions  how incredible it is that in this fragile existence we should hate and destroy one another there are possibilities enough for all who will abandon mastery over others to pursue mastery over nature there is world enough for all to seek their happiness in their own way  our nation course is abundantly clear we aspire to nothing that belongs to others we seek no dominion over our fellow man but man dominion over tyranny and misery  but more is required men want to be part of a common enterprise a cause greater than themselves and each of us must find a way to advance the purpose of the nation thus finding new purpose for ourselves without this we will simply become a nation of strangers  the third article is union to those who were small and few against the wilderness the success of liberty demanded the strength of union two centuries of change have made this true again  no longer need capitalist and worker farmer and clerk city and countryside struggle to divide our bounty by working shoulder to shoulder together we can increase the bounty of all we have discovered that every child who learns and every man who finds work and every sick body that is made whole—like a candle added to an altar—brightens the hope of all the faithful  so let us reject any among us who seek to reopen old wounds and rekindle old hatreds they stand in the way of a seeking nation  let us now join reason to faith and action

ourselves in a short span of years.', 'the next man to stand here will look out on a scene that is different from our own.', 'ours is a time of change—rapid and fantastic change—bearing the secrets of nature, multiplying the nations, placing in uncertain hands new weapons for mastery and destruction, shaking old values and uprooting old ways.', 'our destiny in the midst of change will rest on the unchanged character of our people and on their faith.', 'they came here—the exile and the stranger, brave but frightened—to find a place where a man could be his own man.', 'they made a covenant with this land.', 'conceived in justice, written in liberty, bound in union, it was meant one day to inspire the hopes of all mankind.', 'and it binds us still.', 'if we keep its terms we shall flourish.', 'first, justice was the promise that all who made the journey would share in the fruits of the land.', 'in a land of great wealth, families must not live in hopeless poverty.', 'in a land rich in harvest, children just must not go hungry.', 'in a land of healing miracles, neighbors must not suffer and die untended.', 'in a great land of learning and scholars, young people must be taught to read and write.', 'for more than 30 years that i have served this nation i have believed that this injustice to our people, this waste of our resources, was our real enemy.', 'for 30 years or more, with the resources i have had, i have vigilantly fought against it.', 'i have learned and i know that it will not surrender easily.', 'but change has given us new weapons.', 'before this generation of americans is finished, this enemy will not only retreat, it will be conquered.', 'justice requires us to remember: when any citizen denies his fellow, saying: ""his color is not mine or his beliefs are strange and different,"" in that moment he betrays america, though his forebears created this nation.', 'liberty was the second article of our covenant.', 'it was self-government.', 'it was our bill of rights.', 'but it was more.', 'america would be a place where each man could be proud to be himself: stretching his talents, rejoicing in his work, important in the life of his neighbors and his nation.', 'this has become more difficult in a world where change and growth seem to tower beyond the control and even the judgment of men.', 'we must work to provide the knowledge and the surroundings which can enlarge the possibilities of every citizen.', 'the american covenant called on us to help show the way for the liberation of man.', 'and that is today our goal.', 'thus, if as a nation, there is much outside our control, as a people no stranger is outside our hope.', 'change has brought new meaning to that old mission.', 'we can never again stand aside, prideful in isolation.', 'terrific dangers and troubles that we once called ""foreign"" now constantly live among us.', 'if american lives must end, and american treasure be spilled, in countries that we barely know, then that is the price that change has demanded of conviction and of our enduring covenant.', 'think of our world as it looks from that rocket that is heading toward mars.', ""it is like a child's globe, hanging in space, the continent stuck to its side like colored maps."", 'we are all fellow passengers on a dot of earth.', 'and each of us, in the span of time, has really only a moment among our companions.', 'how incredible it is that in this fragile existence we should hate and destroy one another.', 'there are possibilities enough for all who will abandon mastery over others to pursue mastery over nature.', 'there is world enough for all to seek their happiness in their own way.', ""our nation's course is abundantly clear."", 'we aspire to nothing that belongs to others.', ""we seek no dominion over our fellow man, but man's dominion over tyranny and misery."", 'but more is required.', 'men want to be part of a common enterprise, a cause greater than themselves.', 'and each of us must find a way to advance the purpose of the nation, thus finding new purpose for ourselves.', 'without this, we will simply become a nation of strangers.', 'the third article is union.', 'to those who were small and few against the wilderness, the success of liberty demanded the strength of union.', 'two centuries of change have made this true again.', 'no longer need capitalist and worker, farmer and clerk, city and countryside, struggle to divide our bounty.', 'by working shoulder to shoulder together we can increase the bounty of all.', 'we have discovered that every child who learns, and every man who finds work, and every sick body that is made whole—like a candle added to an altar—brightens the hope of all the faithful.', 'so let us reject any among us who seek to reopen old wounds and rekindle old hatreds.', 'they stand in the way of a seeking nation.', 'let us now join reason to faith and action to experience, to transform our unity of interest into a unity of purpose.', 'for the hour and the day and the time are here to achieve progress without strife, to achieve change without hatred; not without difference of opinion but without the deep and abiding divisions which scar the union for generations.', 'under this covenant of justice, liberty, and union we have become a nation—prosperous, great, and mighty.', 'and we have kept our freedom.', 'but we have no promise from god that our greatness will endure.', 'we have been allowed by him to seek greatness with the sweat of our hands and the strength of our spirit.', 'i do not believe that the great society is the ordered, changeless, and sterile battalion of the ants.', 'it is the excitement of becoming—always becoming, trying, probing, falling, resting, and trying again—but always trying and always gaining.', 'in each generation, with toil and tears, we have had to earn our heritage again.', 'if we fail now then we will have forgotten in abundance what we learned in hardship: that democracy rests on faith, that freedom asks more than it gives, and the judgment of god is harshest on those who are most favored.', 'if we succeed it will not be because of what we have, but it will be because of what we are; not because of what we own, but rather because of what we believe.', 'for we are a nation of believers.', ""underneath the clamor of building and the rush of our day's pursuits, we are believers in justice and liberty and in our own union."", 'we believe that every man must some day be free.', 'and we believe in ourselves.', 'and that is the mistake that our enemies have always made.', 'in my lifetime, in depression and in war they have awaited our defeat.', 'each time, from the secret places of the american heart, came forth the faith that they could not see or that they could not even imagine.', 'and it brought us victory.', 'and it will again.', 'for this is what america is all about.', 'it is the uncrossed desert and the unclimbed ridge.', 'it is the star that is not reached and the harvest that is sleeping in the unplowed ground.', 'is our world gone?', 'we say farewell.', 'is a new world coming?', 'we welcome it, and we will bend it to the hopes of man.', 'and to these trusted public servants and to my family, and those close friends of mine who have followed me down a long winding road, and to all the people of this union and the world, i will repeat today what i said on that sorrowful day in november last year: i will lead and i will do the best i can.', 'but you, you must look within your own hearts to the old promises and to the old dreams.', 'they will lead you best of all.', 'for myself, i ask only in the words of an ancient leader: ""give me now wisdom and knowledge, that i may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?""']","['fellow', 'countrymen', 'occasion', 'oath', 'take', 'god', 'mine', 'alone', 'together', 'one', 'nation', 'one', 'people', 'fate', 'nation',

John F. Kennedy,"January 20, 1961","
      
      Vice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, Reverend Clergy, fellow citizens:
We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom—symbolizing an end as well as a beginning—signifying renewal as well as change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago.
The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe—the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God.
We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans—born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage—and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.
Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.
This much we pledge—and more.
To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United, there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided, there is little we can do—for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.
To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own' freedom—and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.
To those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required—not because the communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.
To our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge—to convert our good words into good deeds—in a new alliance for progress—to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty. But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas. And let every other power know that this Hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house.
To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support—to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective—to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak—and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.
Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.
We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient, beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.
But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course—both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war.
So let us begin anew—remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.
Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.
Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms—and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.
Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce.
Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah—to ""undo the heavy burdens . . . (and) let the oppressed go free.""
And if a beach-head of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of power, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved.
All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.
In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.
Now the trumpet summons us again—not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need—not as a call to battle, though embattled we are—but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, ""rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation""—a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself.
Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?
In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility—I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it—and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.
And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.
My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.
Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own.

this time and place to friend and foe alike that the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans—born in this century tempered by war disciplined by a hard and bitter peace proud of our ancient heritage—and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed and to which we are committed today at home and around the

word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny we shall not always expect to find them supporting our view but we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own' freedom—and to remember that in the past those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside  to those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves for whatever period is required—not because the communists may be doing

unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction  we dare not tempt them with weakness for only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed  but neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course—both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind final war  so let us begin anew—remembering on both sides that

observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom—symbolizing an end as well as a beginning—signifying renewal as well as change.', 'for i have sworn before you and almighty god the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago.', 'the world is very different now.', 'for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.', 'and yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe—the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of god.', 'we dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.', 'let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans—born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage—and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.', 'let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.', 'this much we pledge—and more.', 'to those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends.', 'united, there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures.', 'divided, there is little we can do—for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder.', 'to those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny.', 'we shall not always expect to find them supporting our view.', ""but we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own' freedom—and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside."", 'to those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required—not because the communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right.', 'if a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.', 'to our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge—to convert our good words into good deeds—in a new alliance for progress—to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty.', 'but this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers.', 'let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the americas.', 'and let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house.', 'to that world assembly of sovereign states, the united nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support—to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective—to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak—and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.', 'finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.', 'we dare not tempt them with weakness.', 'for only when our arms are sufficient, beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.', ""but neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course—both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war."", 'so let us begin anew—remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof.', 'let us never negotiate out of fear.', 'but let us never fear to negotiate.', 'let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us.', 'let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms—and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations.', 'let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors.', 'together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce.', 'let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of isaiah—to ""undo the heavy burdens .', '.', '.', '(and) let the oppressed go free.""', 'and if a beach-head of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of power, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved.', 'all this will not be finished in the first one hundred days.', 'nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet.', 'but let us begin.', 'in your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course.', 'since this country was founded, each generation of americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty.', 'the graves of young americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.', 'now the trumpet summons us again—not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need—not as a call to battle, though embattled we are—but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, ""rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation""—a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself.', 'can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, north and south, east and west, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind?', 'will you join in that historic effort?', 'in the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger.', 'i do not shrink from this responsibility—i welcome it.', 'i do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation.', 'the energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it—and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.', 'and so, my fellow americans: ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.', 'my fellow citizens of the world: ask not what america will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.', 'finally, whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you.', ""with a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking his blessing and his help, but knowing that here on earth god's work must truly be our own.""]","['johnson', 'chief', 'justice', 'eisenhower', 'nixon', 'truman', 'reverend', 'clergy', 'fellow', 'citizens', 'observe', 'today', 'victory', 'party', 'celebration',

Dwight D. Eisenhower,"January 20, 1953","
      
      My friends, before I begin the expression of those thoughts that I deem appropriate to this moment, would you permit me the privilege of uttering a little private prayer of my own. And I ask that you bow your heads:
Almighty God, as we stand here at this moment my future associates in the Executive branch of Government join me in beseeching that Thou will make full and complete our dedication to the service of the people in this throng, and their fellow citizens everywhere.
Give us, we pray, the power to discern clearly right from wrong, and allow all our words and actions to be governed thereby, and by the laws of this land. Especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the people regardless of station, race or calling.
May cooperation be permitted and be the mutual aim of those who, under the concepts of our Constitution, hold to differing political faiths; so that all may work for the good of our beloved country and Thy glory. Amen.
My fellow citizens, the world and we have passed the midway point of a century of continuing challenge. We sense with all our faculties that forces of good and evil are massed and armed and opposed as rarely before in history.
This fact defines the meaning of this day. We are summoned by this honored and historic ceremony to witness more than the act of one citizen swearing his oath of service, in the presence of God. We are called as a people to give testimony in the sight of the world to our faith that the future shall belong to the free.
Since this century's beginning, a time of tempest has seemed to come upon the continents of the earth. Masses of Asia have awakened to strike off shackles of the past. Great nations of Europe have fought their bloodiest wars. Thrones have toppled and their vast empires have disappeared. New nations have been born.
For our own country, it has been a time of recurring trial. We have grown in power and in responsibility. We have passed through the anxieties of depression and of war to a summit unmatched in man's history. Seeking to secure peace in the world, we have had to fight through the forests of the Argonne to the shores of Iwo Jima, and to the cold mountains of Korea.
In the swift rush of great events, we find ourselves groping to know the full sense and meaning of these times in which we live. In our quest of understanding, we beseech God's guidance. We summon all our knowledge of the past and we scan all signs of the future. We bring all our wit and all our will to meet the question:
How far have we come in man's long pilgrimage from darkness toward the light? Are we nearing the light--a day of freedom and of peace for all mankind? Or are the shadows of another night closing in upon us?
Great as are the preoccupations absorbing us at home, concerned as we are with matters that deeply affect our livelihood today and our vision of the future, each of these domestic problems is dwarfed by, and often even created by, this question that involves all humankind.
This trial comes at a moment when man's power to achieve good or to inflict evil surpasses the brightest hopes and the sharpest fears of all ages. We can turn rivers in their courses, level mountains to the plains. Oceans and land and sky are avenues for our colossal commerce. Disease diminishes and life lengthens.
Yet the promise of this life is imperiled by the very genius that has made it possible. Nations amass wealth. Labor sweats to create--and turns out devices to level not only mountains but also cities. Science seems ready to confer upon us, as its final gift, the power to erase human life from this planet.
At such a time in history, we who are free must proclaim anew our faith. This faith is the abiding creed of our fathers. It is our faith in the deathless dignity of man, governed by eternal moral and natural laws.
This faith defines our full view of life. It establishes, beyond debate, those gifts of the Creator that are man's inalienable rights, and that make all men equal in His sight.
In the light of this equality, we know that the virtues most cherished by free people--love of truth, pride of work, devotion to country--all are treasures equally precious in the lives of the most humble and of the most exalted. The men who mine coal and fire furnaces, and balance ledgers, and turn lathes, and pick cotton, and heal the sick and plant corn--all serve as proudly and as profitably for America as the statesmen who draft treaties and the legislators who enact laws.
This faith rules our whole way of life. It decrees that we, the people, elect leaders not to rule but to serve. It asserts that we have the right to choice of our own work and to the reward of our own toil. It inspires the initiative that makes our productivity the wonder of the world. And it warns that any man who seeks to deny equality among all his brothers betrays the spirit of the free and invites the mockery of the tyrant.
It is because we, all of us, hold to these principles that the political changes accomplished this day do not imply turbulence, upheaval or disorder. Rather this change expresses a purpose of strengthening our dedication and devotion to the precepts of our founding documents, a conscious renewal of faith in our country and in the watchfulness of a Divine Providence.
The enemies of this faith know no god but force, no devotion but its use. They tutor men in treason. They feed upon the hunger of others. Whatever defies them, they torture, especially the truth.
Here, then, is joined no argument between slightly differing philosophies. This conflict strikes directly at the faith of our fathers and the lives of our sons. No principle or treasure that we hold, from the spiritual knowledge of our free schools and churches to the creative magic of free labor and capital, nothing lies safely beyond the reach of this struggle.
Freedom is pitted against slavery; lightness against the dark.
The faith we hold belongs not to us alone but to the free of all the world. This common bond binds the grower of rice in Burma and the planter of wheat in Iowa, the shepherd in southern Italy and the mountaineer in the Andes. It confers a common dignity upon the French soldier who dies in Indo-China, the British soldier killed in Malaya, the American life given in Korea.
We know, beyond this, that we are linked to all free peoples not merely by a noble idea but by a simple need. No free people can for long cling to any privilege or enjoy any safety in economic solitude. For all our own material might, even we need markets in the world for the surpluses of our farms and our factories. Equally, we need for these same farms and factories vital materials and products of distant lands. This basic law of interdependence, so manifest in the commerce of peace, applies with thousand-fold intensity in the event of war.
So we are persuaded by necessity and by belief that the strength of all free peoples lies in unity; their danger, in discord.
To produce this unity, to meet the challenge of our time, destiny has laid upon our country the responsibility of the free world's leadership.
So it is proper that we assure our friends once again that, in the discharge of this responsibility, we Americans know and we observe the difference between world leadership and imperialism; between firmness and truculence; between a thoughtfully calculated goal and spasmodic reaction to the stimulus of emergencies.
We wish our friends the world over to know this above all: we face the threat--not with dread and confusion--but with confidence and conviction.
We feel this moral strength because we know that we are not helpless prisoners of history. We are free men. We shall remain free, never to be proven guilty of the one capital offense against freedom, a lack of stanch faith.
In pleading our just cause before the bar of history and in pressing our labor for world peace, we shall be guided by certain fixed principles. These principles are:
1. Abhorring war as a chosen way to balk the purposes of those who threaten us, we hold it to be the first task of statesmanship to develop the strength that will deter the forces of aggression and promote the conditions of peace. For, as it must be the supreme purpose of all free men, so it must be the dedication of their leaders, to save humanity from preying upon itself.
In the light of this principle, we stand ready to engage with any and all others in joint effort to remove the causes of mutual fear and distrust among nations, so as to make possible drastic reduction of armaments. The sole requisites for undertaking such effort are that--in their purpose--they be aimed logically and honestly toward secure peace for all; and that--in their result--they provide methods by which every participating nation will prove good faith in carrying out its pledge.
2. Realizing that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of appeasement, we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked bargain of trading honor for security. Americans, indeed, all free men, remember that in the final choice a soldier's pack is not so heavy a burden as a prisoner's chains.
3. Knowing that only a United States that is strong and immensely productive can help defend freedom in our world, we view our Nation's strength and security as a trust upon which rests the hope of free men everywhere. It is the firm duty of each of our free citizens and of every free citizen everywhere to place the cause of his country before the comfort, the convenience of himself.
4. Honoring the identity and the special heritage of each nation in the world, we shall never use our strength to try to impress upon another people our own cherished political and economic institutions.
5. Assessing realistically the needs and capacities of proven friends of freedom, we shall strive to help them to achieve their own security and well-being. Likewise, we shall count upon them to assume, within the limits of their resources, their full and just burdens in the common defense of freedom.
6. Recognizing economic health as an indispensable basis of military strength and the free world's peace, we shall strive to foster everywhere, and to practice ourselves, policies that encourage productivity and profitable trade. For the impoverishment of any single people in the world means danger to the well-being of all other peoples.
7. Appreciating that economic need, military security and political wisdom combine to suggest regional groupings of free peoples, we hope, within the framework of the United Nations, to help strengthen such special bonds the world over. The nature of these ties must vary with the different problems of different areas.
In the Western Hemisphere, we enthusiastically join with all our neighbors in the work of perfecting a community of fraternal trust and common purpose.
In Europe, we ask that enlightened and inspired leaders of the Western nations strive with renewed vigor to make the unity of their peoples a reality. Only as free Europe unitedly marshals its strength can it effectively safeguard, even with our help, its spiritual and cultural heritage.
8. Conceiving the defense of freedom, like freedom itself, to be one and indivisible, we hold all continents and peoples in equal regard and honor. We reject any insinuation that one race or another, one people or another, is in any sense inferior or expendable.
9. Respecting the United Nations as the living sign of all people's hope for peace, we shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent symbol but an effective force. And in our quest for an honorable peace, we shall neither compromise, nor tire, nor ever cease.
By these rules of conduct, we hope to be known to all peoples.
By their observance, an earth of peace may become not a vision but a fact.
This hope--this supreme aspiration--must rule the way we live.
We must be ready to dare all for our country. For history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid. We must acquire proficiency in defense and display stamina in purpose.
We must be willing, individually and as a Nation, to accept whatever sacrifices may be required of us. A people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both.
These basic precepts are not lofty abstractions, far removed from matters of daily living. They are laws of spiritual strength that generate and define our material strength. Patriotism means equipped forces and a prepared citizenry. Moral stamina means more energy and more productivity, on the farm and in the factory. Love of liberty means the guarding of every resource that makes freedom possible--from the sanctity of our families and the wealth of our soil to the genius of our scientists.
And so each citizen plays an indispensable role. The productivity of our heads, our hands and our hearts is the source of all the strength we can command, for both the enrichment of our lives and the winning of the peace.
No person, no home, no community can be beyond the reach of this call. We are summoned to act in wisdom and in conscience, to work with industry, to teach with persuasion, to preach with conviction, to weigh our every deed with care and with compassion. For this truth must be clear before us: whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of America.
The peace we seek, then, is nothing less than the practice and fulfillment of our whole faith among ourselves and in our dealings with others. This signifies more than the stilling of guns, casing the sorrow of war. More than escape from death, it is a way of life. More than a haven for the weary, it is a hope for the brave.
This is the hope that beckons us onward in this century of trial. This is the work that awaits us all, to be done with bravery, with charity, and with prayer to Almighty God.
My citizens--I thank you.

shall remain free, never to be proven guilty of the one capital offense against freedom, a lack of stanch faith.  in pleading our just cause before the bar of history and in pressing our labor for world peace, we shall be guided by certain fixed principles. these principles are:  1. abhorring war as a chosen way to balk the purposes of those who threaten us, we hold it to be the first task of statesmanship to develop the strength that will deter the forces of aggression and promote the conditions of peace. for, as it must be the supreme purpose of all free men, so it must be the dedication of their leaders, to save humanity from preying upon itself.  in the light of this principle, we stand ready to engage with any and all others in joint effort to remove the causes of mutual fear and distrust among nations, so as to make possible drastic reduction of armaments. the sole requisites for undertaking such effort are that--in their purpose--they be aimed logically and honestly toward secure peace for all; and that--in their result--they provide methods by which every participating nation will prove good faith in carrying out its pledge.  2. realizing that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of appeasement, we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked bargain of trading honor for security. americans, indeed, all free men, remember that in the final choice a soldier's pack is not so heavy a burden as a prisoner's chains.  3. knowing that only a united states that is strong and immensely productive can help defend freedom in our world, we view our nation's strength and security as a trust upon which rests the hope of free men everywhere. it is the firm duty of each of our free citizens and of every free citizen everywhere to place the cause of his country before the comfort, the convenience of himself.  4. honoring the identity and the special heritage of each nation in the world, we shall never use our strength to try to impress upon another people our own cherished political and economic institutions.  5. assessing realistically the needs and capacities of proven friends of freedom, we shall strive to help them to achieve their own security and well-being. likewise, we shall count upon them to assume, within the limits of their resources, their full and just burdens in the common defense of freedom.  6. recognizing economic health as an indispensable basis of military strength and the free world's peace, we shall strive to foster everywhere, and to practice ourselves, policies that encourage productivity and profitable trade. for the impoverishment of any single people in the world means danger to the well-being of all other peoples.  7. appreciating that economic need, military security and political wisdom combine to suggest regional groupings of free peoples, we hope, within the framework of the united nations, to help strengthen such special bonds the world over. the nature of these ties must vary with the different problems of different areas.  in the western hemisphere, we enthusiastically join with all our neighbors in the work of perfecting a community of fraternal trust and common purpose.  in europe, we ask that enlightened and inspired leaders of the western nations strive with renewed vigor to make the unity of their peoples a reality. only as free europe unitedly marshals its strength can it effectively safeguard, even with our help, its spiritual and cultural heritage.  8. conceiving the defense of freedom, like freedom itself, to be one and indivisible, we hold all continents and peoples in equal regard and honor. we reject any insinuation that one race or another, one people or another, is in any sense inferior or expendable.  9. respecting the united nations as the living sign of all people's hope for peace, we shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent symbol but an effective force. and in our quest for an honorable peace, we shall neither compromise, nor tire, nor ever cease.  by these rules of conduct, we hope to be known to all peoples.  by their observance, an earth of peace may become not a vision but a fact.  this hope--this supreme aspiration--must rule the way we live.  we must be ready to dare all for our country. for history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid. we must acquire proficiency in defense and display stamina in purpose.  we must be willing, individually and as a nation, to accept whatever sacrifices may be required of us. a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both.  these basic precepts are not lofty abstractions, far removed from matters of daily living. they are laws of spiritual strength that generate and define our material strength. patriotism means equipped forces and a prepared citizenry. moral stamina means more energy and more productivity, on the farm and in the factory. love of liberty means the guarding of every resource that makes freedom possible--from the sanctity of our families and the wealth of our soil to the genius of our scientists.  and so each citizen plays an indispensable role. the productivity of our heads, our hands and our hearts is the source of all the strength we can command, for both the enrichment of our lives and the winning of the peace.  no person, no home, no community can be beyond the reach of this call. we are summoned to act in wisdom and in conscience, to work with industry, to teach with persuasion, to preach with conviction, to weigh our every deed with care and with compassion. for this truth must be clear before us: whatever america hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of america.  the peace we seek, then, is nothing less than the practice and fulfillment of our whole faith among ourselves and in our dealings with others. this signifies more than the stilling of guns, casing the sorrow of war. more than escape from death, it is a way of life. more than a haven for the weary, it is a hope for the brave.  this is the hope that beckons us onward in this century of trial. this is the work that awaits us all, to be done with bravery, with charity, and with prayer to almighty god.  my citizens--i thank you.  ",    my friends before i begin the expression of those thoughts that i deem appropriate to this moment would you permit me the privilege of uttering a little private prayer of my own and i ask that you bow your heads  almighty god as we stand here at this moment my future associates in the executive branch of government join me in beseeching that thou will make full and complete our dedication to the service of the people in this throng and their fellow citizens everywhere  give us we pray the power to discern clearly right from wrong and allow all our words and actions to be governed thereby and by the laws of this land especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the people regardless of station race or calling  may cooperation be permitted and be the mutual aim of those who under the concepts of our constitution hold to differing political faiths so that all may work for the good of our beloved country and thy glory amen  my fellow citizens the world and we have passed the midway point of a century of continuing challenge we sense with all our faculties that forces of good and evil are massed and armed and opposed as rarely before in history  this fact defines the meaning of this day we are summoned by this honored and historic ceremony to witness more than the act of one citizen swearing his oath of service in the presence of god we are called as a people to give testimony in the sight of the world to our faith that the future shall belong to the free  since this century's beginning a time of tempest has seemed to come upon the continents of the earth masses of asia have awakened to strike off shackles of the past great nations of europe have fought their bloodiest wars thrones have toppled and their vast empires have disappeared new nations have been born  for our own country it has been a time of recurring trial we have grown in power and in responsibility we have passed through the anxieties of depression and of war to a summit unmatched in man's history seeking to secure peace in the world we have had to fight through the forests of the argonne to the shores of iwo jima and to the cold mountains of korea  in the swift rush of great events we find ourselves groping to know the full sense and meaning of these times in which we live in our quest of understanding we beseech god's guidance we summon all our knowledge of the past and we scan all signs of the future we bring all our wit and all our will to meet the question  how far have we come in man's long pilgrimage from darkness toward the light are we nearing the light--a day of freedom and of peace for all mankind or are the shadows of another night closing in upon us  great as are the preoccupations absorbing us at home concerned as we are with matters that deeply affect our livelihood today and our vision of the future each of these domestic problems is dwarfed by and often even created by this question that involves all humankind  this trial comes at a moment when man's power to achieve good or to inflict evil surpasses the brightest hopes and the sharpest fears of all ages we can turn rivers in their courses level mountains to the plains oceans and land and sky are avenues for our colossal commerce disease diminishes and life lengthens  yet the promise of this life is imperiled by the very genius that has made it possible nations amass wealth labor sweats to create--and turns out devices to level not only mountains but also cities science seems ready to confer upon us as its final gift the power to erase human life from this planet  at such a time in history we who are free must proclaim anew our faith this faith is the abiding creed of our fathers it is our faith in the deathless dignity of man governed by eternal moral and natural laws  this faith defines our full view of life it establishes beyond debate those gifts of the creator that are man's inalienable rights and that make all men equal in his sight  in the light of this equality we know that the virtues most cherished by free people--love of truth pride of work devotion to country--all are treasures equally precious in the lives of the most humble and of the most exalted the men who mine coal and fire furnaces and balance ledgers and turn lathes and pick cotton and heal the sick and plant corn--all serve as proudly and as profitably for america as the statesmen who draft treaties and the legislators who enact laws  this faith rules our whole way of life it decrees that we the people elect leaders not to rule but to serve it asserts that we have the right to choice of our own work and to the reward of our own toil it inspires the initiative that makes our productivity the wonder of the world and it warns that any man who seeks to deny equality among all his brothers betrays the spirit of the free and invites the mockery of the tyrant  it is because we all of us hold to these principles that the political changes accomplished this day do not imply turbulence upheaval or disorder rather this change expresses a purpose of strengthening our dedication and devotion to the precepts of our founding documents a conscious renewal of faith in our country and in the watchfulness of a divine providence  the enemies of this faith know no god but force no devotion but its use they tutor men in treason they feed upon the hunger of others whatever defies them they torture especially the truth  here then is joined no argument between slightly differing philosophies this conflict strikes directly at the faith of our fathers and the lives of our sons no principle or treasure that we hold from the spiritual knowledge of our free schools and churches to the creative magic of free labor and capital nothing lies safely beyond the reach of this struggle  freedom is pitted against slavery lightness against the dark  the faith we hold belongs not to us alone but to the free of all the world this common bond binds the grower of rice in burma and the planter of wheat in iowa the shepherd in southern italy and the mountaineer in the andes it confers a common dignity upon the french soldier who dies in indo-china the british soldier killed in malaya the american life given in korea  we know beyond this that we are linked to all free peoples not merely by a noble idea but by a simple need no free people can for long cling to any privilege or enjoy any safety in economic solitude for all our own material might even we need markets in the world for the surpluses of our farms and our factories equally we need for these same farms and factories vital materials and products of distant lands this basic law of interdependence so manifest in the commerce of peace applies with thousand-fold intensity in the event of war  so we are persuaded by necessity and by belief that the strength of all free peoples lies in unity their danger in discord  to produce this unity to meet the challenge of our time destiny has laid upon our country the responsibility of the free world's leadership  so it is proper that we assure our friends once again that in the discharge of this responsibility we americans know and we observe the difference between world leadership and imperialism between firmness and truculence between a thoughtfully calculated goal and spasmodic reaction to the stimulus of emergencies  we wish our friends the world over to know this above all we face the threat--not with dread and confusion--but with confidence and conviction  we feel this moral strength because we know that we are not helpless

in indo-china the british soldier kill in malaya the american life give in korea  we know beyond this that we be link to all free people not merely by a noble idea but by a simple need no free people can for long cling to any privilege or enjoy any safety in economic solitude for all our own material might even we need market in the world for the surpluses of our farm and our factories equally we need for these same farm and factories vital materials and products of distant land this basic law of interdependence so manifest in the commerce of peace apply with thousand-fold intensity in the event of war  so we be persuade by necessity and by belief that the strength of all free people lie in unity their danger in discord  to produce this unity to meet the challenge of our time destiny have lay upon our country the responsibility of the free world leadership  so it be proper that we assure our friends once again that in the discharge of this responsibility we americans know and we observe the difference between world leadership and imperialism between firmness and truculence between a thoughtfully calculate goal and spasmodic reaction to the stimulus of emergencies  we wish our friends the world over to know this above all we face the threat--not with dread and confusion--but with confidence and conviction  we feel this moral strength because we know that we be not helpless prisoners of history we be free men we shall remain free never to be prove guilty of the one capital offense against freedom a lack of stanch faith  in plead our just cause before the bar of history and in press our labor for world peace we shall be guide by certain fix principles these principles be  1 abhor war as a choose way to balk the purpose of those who threaten us we hold it to be the first task of statesmanship to develop the strength that will deter the force of aggression and promote the condition of peace for as it must be the supreme purpose of all free men so it must be the dedication of their leaders to save humanity from prey upon itself  in the light of this principle we stand ready to engage with any and all others in joint effort to remove the cause of mutual fear and distrust among nations so as to make possible drastic reduction of armaments the sole requisites for undertake such effort be that--in their purpose--they be aim logically and honestly toward secure peace for all and that--in their result--they provide methods by which every participate nation will prove good faith in carry out its pledge  2 realize that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of appeasement we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked bargain of trade honor for security americans indeed all free men remember that in the final choice a soldier pack be not so heavy a burden as a prisoner chain  3 know that only a unite state that be strong and immensely productive can help defend freedom in our world we view our nation strength and security as a trust upon which rest the hope of free men everywhere it be the firm duty of each of our free citizens and of every free citizen everywhere to place the cause of his country before the comfort the convenience of himself  4 honor the identity and the special heritage of each nation in the world we shall never use our strength to try to impress upon another people our own cherish political and economic institutions  5 assess realistically the need and capacities of prove friends of freedom we shall strive to help them to achieve their own security and well-being likewise we shall count upon them to assume within the limit of their resources their full and just burden in the common defense of freedom  6 recognize economic health as an indispensable basis of military strength and the free world peace we shall strive to foster everywhere and to practice ourselves policies that encourage productivity and profitable trade for the impoverishment of any single

nations strive with renew vigor to make the unity of their people a reality only as free europe unitedly marshal its strength can it effectively safeguard even with our help its spiritual and cultural heritage  8 conceive the defense of freedom like freedom itself to be one and indivisible we hold all continents and people in equal regard and honor we reject any insinuation that one race or another one people or another be in any sense inferior or expendable  9 respect the unite nations as the live sign of all people hope for peace we shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent symbol but an effective force and in our quest for an honorable peace we shall neither compromise nor tire nor ever cease  by these rule of conduct we hope to be know to all people  by their observance an earth of

appropriate to this moment, would you permit me the privilege of uttering a little private prayer of my own.', 'and i ask that you bow your heads:  almighty god, as we stand here at this moment my future associates in the executive branch of government join me in beseeching that thou will make full and complete our dedication to the service of the people in this throng, and their fellow citizens everywhere.', 'give us, we pray, the power to discern clearly right from wrong, and allow all our words and actions to be governed thereby, and by the laws of this land.', 'especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the people regardless of station, race or calling.', 'may cooperation be permitted and be the mutual aim of those who, under the concepts of our constitution, hold to differing political faiths; so that all may work for the good of our beloved country and thy glory.', 'amen.', 'my fellow citizens, the world and we have passed the midway point of a century of continuing challenge.', 'we sense with all our faculties that forces of good and evil are massed and armed and opposed as rarely before in history.', 'this fact defines the meaning of this day.', 'we are summoned by this honored and historic ceremony to witness more than the act of one citizen swearing his oath of service, in the presence of god.', 'we are called as a people to give testimony in the sight of the world to our faith that the future shall belong to the free.', ""since this century's beginning, a time of tempest has seemed to come upon the continents of the earth."", 'masses of asia have awakened to strike off shackles of the past.', 'great nations of europe have fought their bloodiest wars.', 'thrones have toppled and their vast empires have disappeared.', 'new nations have been born.', 'for our own country, it has been a time of recurring trial.', 'we have grown in power and in responsibility.', ""we have passed through the anxieties of depression and of war to a summit unmatched in man's history."", 'seeking to secure peace in the world, we have had to fight through the forests of the argonne to the shores of iwo jima, and to the cold mountains of korea.', 'in the swift rush of great events, we find ourselves groping to know the full sense and meaning of these times in which we live.', ""in our quest of understanding, we beseech god's guidance."", 'we summon all our knowledge of the past and we scan all signs of the future.', ""we bring all our wit and all our will to meet the question:  how far have we come in man's long pilgrimage from darkness toward the light?"", 'are we nearing the light--a day of freedom and of peace for all mankind?', 'or are the shadows of another night closing in upon us?', 'great as are the preoccupations absorbing us at home, concerned as we are with matters that deeply affect our livelihood today and our vision of the future, each of these domestic problems is dwarfed by, and often even created by, this question that involves all humankind.', ""this trial comes at a moment when man's power to achieve good or to inflict evil surpasses the brightest hopes and the sharpest fears of all ages."", 'we can turn

imperiled by the very genius that has made it possible.', 'nations amass wealth.', 'labor sweats to create--and turns out devices to level not only mountains but also cities.', 'science seems ready to confer upon us, as its final gift, the power to erase human life from this planet.', 'at such a time in history, we who are free must proclaim anew our faith.', 'this faith is the abiding creed of our fathers.', 'it is our faith in the deathless dignity of man, governed by eternal moral and natural laws.', 'this faith defines our full view of life.', ""it establishes, beyond debate, those gifts of the creator that are man's inalienable rights, and that make all men equal in his sight."", 'in the light of this equality, we know that the virtues most cherished by free people--love of truth, pride of work, devotion to country--all are treasures equally precious in the lives of the most humble and of the most exalted.', 'the men who mine coal and fire furnaces, and balance ledgers, and turn lathes, and pick cotton, and heal the sick and plant corn--all serve as proudly and as profitably for america as the statesmen who draft treaties and the legislators who enact laws.', 'this faith rules our whole way of life.', 'it decrees that we, the people, elect leaders not to rule but to serve.', 'it asserts that we have the right to choice of our own work and to the reward of our own toil.', 'it inspires the initiative that makes our productivity the wonder of the world.', 'and it warns that any man who seeks to deny equality among all his brothers betrays the spirit of the free and invites the mockery of the tyrant.', 'it is because we, all of us, hold to these principles that the political changes accomplished this day do not imply turbulence, upheaval or disorder.', 'rather this change expresses a purpose of strengthening our dedication and devotion to the precepts of our founding documents, a conscious renewal of faith in our country and in the watchfulness of a divine providence.', 'the enemies of this faith know no god but force, no devotion but its use.', 'they tutor men in treason.', 'they feed upon the hunger of others.', 'whatever defies them, they torture, especially the truth.', 'here, then, is joined no argument between slightly differing philosophies.', 'this conflict strikes directly at the faith of our fathers and the lives of our sons.', 'no principle or treasure that we hold, from the spiritual knowledge of our free schools and churches to the creative magic of free labor and capital, nothing lies safely beyond the reach of this struggle.', 'freedom is pitted against slavery; lightness against the dark.', 'the faith we hold belongs not to us alone but to the free of all the world.', 'this common bond binds the grower of rice in burma and the planter of wheat in iowa, the shepherd in southern italy and the mountaineer in the andes.', 'it confers a common dignity upon the french soldier who dies in indo-china, the british soldier killed in malaya, the american life given in korea.', 'we know, beyond this, that we are linked to all free peoples not merely by a noble idea but by a simple need.', 'no free people can for long cling to any privilege or enjoy any safety in economic solitude.', 'for all our own material might, even we need markets in the world for the surpluses of our farms and our factories.', 'equally, we need for these same farms and factories vital materials and products of distant lands.', 'this basic law of interdependence, so manifest in the commerce of peace, applies with thousand-fold intensity in the event of war.', 'so we are persuaded by necessity and by belief that the strength of all free peoples lies in unity; their danger, in discord.', ""to produce this unity, to meet the challenge of our time, destiny has laid upon our country the responsibility of the free world's leadership."", 'so it is proper that we assure our friends once again that, in the discharge of this responsibility, we americans know and we observe the difference between world leadership and imperialism; between firmness and truculence; between a thoughtfully calculated goal and spasmodic reaction to the stimulus of emergencies.', 'we wish our friends the world over to know this above all: we face the threat--not with dread and confusion--but with confidence and conviction.', 'we feel this moral strength because we know that we are not helpless prisoners of history.', 'we are free men.', 'we shall remain free, never to be proven guilty of the one capital offense against freedom, a lack of stanch faith.', 'in pleading our just cause before the bar of history and in pressing our labor for world peace, we shall be guided by certain fixed principles.', 'these principles are:  1. abhorring war as a chosen way to balk the purposes of those who threaten us, we hold it to be the first task of statesmanship to develop the strength that will deter the forces of aggression and promote the conditions of peace.', 'for, as it must be the supreme purpose of all free men, so it must be the dedication of their leaders, to save humanity from preying upon itself.', 'in the light of this principle, we stand ready to engage with any and all others in joint effort to remove the causes of mutual fear and distrust among nations, so as to make possible drastic reduction of armaments.', 'the sole requisites for undertaking such effort are that--in their purpose--they be aimed logically and honestly toward secure peace for all; and that--in their result--they provide methods by which every participating nation will prove good faith in carrying out its pledge.', '2. realizing that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of appeasement, we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked bargain of trading honor for security.', ""americans, indeed, all free men, remember that in the final choice a soldier's pack is not so heavy a burden as a prisoner's chains."", ""3. knowing that only a united states that is strong and immensely productive can help defend freedom in our world, we view our nation's strength and security as a trust upon which rests the hope of free men everywhere."", 'it is the firm duty of each of our free citizens and of every free citizen everywhere to place the cause of his country before the comfort, the convenience of himself.', '4. honoring the identity and the special heritage of each nation in the world, we shall never use our strength to try to impress upon another people our own cherished political and economic institutions.', '5. assessing realistically the needs and capacities of proven friends of freedom, we shall strive to help them to achieve their own security and well-being.', 'likewise, we shall count upon them to assume, within the limits of their resources, their full and just burdens in the common defense of freedom.', ""6. recognizing economic health as an indispensable basis of military strength and the free world's peace, we shall strive to foster everywhere, and to practice ourselves, policies that encourage productivity and profitable trade."", 'for the impoverishment of any single people in the world means danger to the well-being of all other peoples.', '7. appreciating that economic need, military security and political wisdom combine to suggest regional groupings of free peoples, we hope, within the framework of the united nations, to help strengthen such special bonds the world over.', 'the nature of these ties must vary with the different problems of different areas.', 'in the western hemisphere, we enthusiastically join with all our neighbors in the work of perfecting a community of fraternal trust and common purpose.', 'in europe, we ask that enlightened and inspired leaders of the western nations strive with renewed vigor to make the unity of their peoples a reality.', 'only as free europe unitedly marshals its strength can it effectively safeguard, even with our help, its spiritual and cultural heritage.', '8. conceiving the defense of freedom, like freedom itself, to be one and indivisible, we hold all continents and peoples in equal regard and honor.', 'we reject any insinuation that one race or another, one people or another, is in any sense inferior or expendable.', ""9. respecting the united nations as the living sign of all people's hope for peace, we shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent symbol but an effective force."", 'and in our quest for an honorable peace, we shall neither compromise, nor tire, nor ever cease.', 'by these rules of conduct, we hope to be known to all peoples.', 'by their observance, an earth of peace may become not a vision but a fact.', 'this hope--this supreme aspiration--must rule the way we live.', 'we must be ready to dare all for our country.', 'for history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid.', 'we must acquire proficiency in defense and display stamina in purpose.', 'we must be willing, individually and as a nation, to accept whatever sacrifices may be required of us.', 'a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both.', 'these basic precepts are not lofty abstractions, far removed from matters of daily living.', 'they are laws of spiritual strength that generate and define our material strength.', 'patriotism means equipped forces and a prepared citizenry.', 'moral stamina means more energy and more productivity, on the farm and in the factory.', 'love of liberty means the guarding of every resource that makes freedom possible--from the sanctity of our families and the wealth of our soil to the genius of our scientists.', 'and so each citizen plays an indispensable role.', 'the productivity of our heads, our hands and our hearts is the source of all the strength we can command, for both the enrichment of our lives and the winning of the peace.', 'no person, no home, no community can be beyond the reach of this call.', 'we are summoned to act in wisdom and in conscience, to work with industry, to teach with persuasion, to preach with conviction, to weigh our every deed with care and with compassion.', 'for this truth must be clear before us: whatever america hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of america.', 'the peace we seek, then, is nothing less than the practice and fulfillment of our whole faith among ourselves and in our dealings with others.', 'this signifies more than the stilling of guns, casing the sorrow of war.', 'more than escape from death, it is a way of life.', 'more than a haven for the weary, it is a hope for the brave.', 'this is the hope that beckons us onward in this century of trial.', 'this is the work that awaits us all, to be done with bravery, with charity, and with prayer to almighty god.', 'my citizens--i thank you.']","['friends', 'begin',

Harry S. Truman,"January 20, 1949","
      
      Mr. Vice President, Mr. Chief Justice, fellow citizens:
I accept with humility the honor which the American people have conferred upon me. I accept it with a resolve to do all that I can for the welfare of this Nation and for the peace of the world.
In performing the duties of my office, I need the help and the prayers of every one of you. I ask for your encouragement and for your support. The tasks we face are difficult. We can accomplish them only if we work together.
Each period of our national history has had its special challenges. Those that confront us now are as momentous as any in the past. Today marks the beginning not only of a new administration, but of a period that will be eventful, perhaps decisive, for us and for the world.
It may be our lot to experience, and in a large measure bring about, a major turning point in the long history of the human race. The first half of this century has been marked by unprecedented and brutal attacks on the rights of man, and by the two most frightful wars in history. The supreme need of our time is for men to learn to live together in peace and harmony.
The peoples of the earth face the future with grave uncertainty, composed almost equally of great hopes and great fears. In this time of doubt, they look to the United States as never before for good will, strength, and wise leadership.
It is fitting, therefore, that we take this occasion to proclaim to the world the essential principles of the faith by which we live, and to declare our aims to all peoples.
The American people stand firm in the faith which has inspired this Nation from the beginning. We believe that all men have a right to equal justice under law and equal opportunity to share in the common good. We believe that all men have a right to freedom of thought and expression. We believe that all men are created equal because they are created in the image of God.
From this faith we will not be moved.
The American people desire, and are determined to work for, a world in which all nations and all peoples are free to govern themselves as they see fit, and to achieve a decent and satisfying life. Above all else, our people desire, and are determined to work for, peace on earth—a just and lasting peace—based on genuine agreement freely arrived at by equals.
In the pursuit of these aims, the United States and other like-minded nations find themselves directly opposed by a regime with contrary aims and a totally different concept of life.
That regime adheres to a false philosophy which purports to offer freedom, security, and greater opportunity to mankind. Misled by that philosophy, many peoples have sacrificed their liberties only to learn to their sorrow that deceit and mockery, poverty and tyranny, are their reward.
That false philosophy is communism.
Communism is based on the belief that man is so weak and inadequate that he is unable to govern himself, and therefore requires the rule of strong masters.
Democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and intellectual capacity, as well as the inalienable right, to govern himself with reason and justice.
Communism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause, punishment without trial, and forced labor as the chattel of the state. It decrees what information he shall receive, what art he shall produce, what leaders he shall follow, and what thoughts he shall think.
Democracy maintains that government is established for the benefit of the individual, and is charged with the responsibility of protecting the rights of the individual and his freedom in the exercise of those abilities of his.
Communism maintains that social wrongs can be corrected only by violence.
Democracy has proved that social justice can be achieved through peaceful change.
Communism holds that the world is so widely divided into opposing classes that war is inevitable.
Democracy holds that free nations can settle differences justly and maintain a lasting peace.
These differences between communism and democracy do not concern the United States alone. People everywhere are coming to realize that what is involved is material well-being, human dignity, and the right to believe in and worship God.
I state these differences, not to draw issues of belief as such, but because the actions resulting from the Communist philosophy are a threat to the efforts of free nations to bring about world recovery and lasting peace.
Since the end of hostilities, the United States has invested its substance and its energy in a great constructive effort to restore peace, stability, and freedom to the world.
We have sought no territory. We have imposed our will on none. We have asked for no privileges we would not extend to others.
We have constantly and vigorously supported the United Nations and related agencies as a means of applying democratic principles to international relations. We have consistently advocated and relied upon peaceful settlement of disputes among nations.
We have made every effort to secure agreement on effective international control of our most powerful weapon, and we have worked steadily for the limitation and control of all armaments.
We have encouraged, by precept and example, the expansion of world trade on a sound and fair basis.
Almost a year ago, in company with 16 free nations of Europe, we launched the greatest cooperative economic program in history. The purpose of that unprecedented effort is to invigorate and strengthen democracy in Europe, so that the free people of that continent can resume their rightful place in the forefront of civilization and can contribute once more to the security and welfare of the world.
Our efforts have brought new hope to all mankind. We have beaten back despair and defeatism. We have saved a number of countries from losing their liberty. Hundreds of millions of people all over the world now agree with us, that we need not have war—that we can have peace.
The initiative is ours.
We are moving on with other nations to build an even stronger structure of international order and justice. We shall have as our partners countries which, no longer solely concerned with the problem of national survival, are now working to improve the standards of living of all their people. We are ready to undertake new projects to strengthen a free world.
In the coming years, our program for peace and freedom will emphasize four major courses of action.
First, we will continue to give unfaltering support to the United Nations and related agencies, and we will continue to search for ways to strengthen their authority and increase their effectiveness. We believe that the United Nations will be strengthened by the new nations which are being formed in lands now advancing toward self-government under democratic principles.
Second, we will continue our programs for world economic recovery.
This means, first of all, that we must keep our full weight behind the European recovery program. We are confident of the success of this major venture in world recovery. We believe that our partners in this effort will achieve the status of self-supporting nations once again.
In addition, we must carry out our plans for reducing the barriers to world trade and increasing its volume. Economic recovery and peace itself depend on increased world trade.
Third, we will strengthen freedom-loving nations against the dangers of aggression.
We are now working out with a number of countries a joint agreement designed to strengthen the security of the North Atlantic area. Such an agreement would take the form of a collective defense arrangement within the terms of the United Nations Charter.
We have already established such a defense pact for the Western Hemisphere by the treaty of Rio de Janeiro.
The primary purpose of these agreements is to provide unmistakable proof of the joint determination of the free countries to resist armed attack from any quarter. Every country participating in these arrangements must contribute all it can to the common defense.
If we can make it sufficiently clear, in advance, that any armed attack affecting our national security would be met with overwhelming force, the armed attack might never occur.
I hope soon to send to the Senate a treaty respecting the North Atlantic security plan.
In addition, we will provide military advice and equipment to free nations which will cooperate with us in the maintenance of peace and security.
Fourth, we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas.
More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of disease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas.
For the first time in history, humanity posesses the knowledge and skill to relieve suffering of these people.
The United States is pre-eminent among nations in the development of industrial and scientific techniques. The material resources which we can afford to use for assistance of other peoples are limited. But our imponderable resources in technical knowledge are constantly growing and are inexhaustible.
I believe that we should make available to peace-loving peoples the benefits of our store of technical knowledge in order to help them realize their aspirations for a better life. And, in cooperation with other nations, we should foster capital investment in areas needing development.
Our aim should be to help the free peoples of the world, through their own efforts, to produce more food, more clothing, more materials for housing, and more mechanical power to lighten their burdens.
We invite other countries to pool their technological resources in this undertaking. Their contributions will be warmly welcomed. This should be a cooperative enterprise in which all nations work together through the United Nations and its specialized agencies whenever practicable. It must be a worldwide effort for the achievement of peace, plenty, and freedom.
With the cooperation of business, private capital, agriculture, and labor in this country, this program can greatly increase the industrial activity in other nations and can raise substantially their standards of living.
Such new economic developments must be devised and controlled to the benefit of the peoples of the areas in which they are established. Guarantees to the investor must be balanced by guarantees in the interest of the people whose resources and whose labor go into these developments.
The old imperialism—exploitation for foreign profit—has no place in our plans. What we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair-dealing.
All countries, including our own, will greatly benefit from a constructive program for the better use of the world's human and natural resources. Experience shows that our commerce with other countries expands as they progress industrially and economically.
Greater production is the key to prosperity and peace. And the key to greater production is a wider and more vigorous application of modern scientific and technical knowledge.
Only by helping the least fortunate of its members to help themselves can the human family achieve the decent, satisfying life that is the right of all people.
Democracy alone can supply the vitalizing force to stir the peoples of the world into triumphant action, not only against their human oppressors, but also against their ancient enemies—hunger, misery, and despair.
On the basis of these four major courses of action we hope to help create the conditions that will lead eventually to personal freedom and happiness for all mankind.
If we are to be successful in carrying out these policies, it is clear that we must have continued prosperity in this country and we must keep ourselves strong.
Slowly but surely we are weaving a world fabric of international security and growing prosperity.
We are aided by all who wish to live in freedom from fear—even by those who live today in fear under their own governments.
We are aided by all who want relief from lies and propaganda—those who desire truth and sincerity.
We are aided by all who desire self-government and a voice in deciding their own affairs.
We are aided by all who long for economic security—for the security and abundance that men in free societies can enjoy.
We are aided by all who desire freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to live their own lives for useful ends.
Our allies are the millions who hunger and thirst after righteousness.
In due time, as our stability becomes manifest, as more and more nations come to know the benefits of democracy and to participate in growing abundance, I believe that those countries which now oppose us will abandon their delusions and join with the free nations of the world in a just settlement of international differences.
Events have brought our American democracy to new influence and new responsibilities. They will test our courage, our devotion to duty, and our concept of liberty.
But I say to all men, what we have achieved in liberty, we will surpass in greater liberty.
Steadfast in our faith in the Almighty, we will advance toward a world where man's freedom is secure.
To that end we will devote our strength, our resources, and our firmness of resolve. With God's help, the future of mankind will be assured in a world of justice, harmony, and peace.

recovery and peace itself depend on increased world trade.  third, we will strengthen freedom-loving nations against the dangers of aggression.  we are now working out with a number of countries a joint agreement designed to strengthen the security of the north atlantic area. such an agreement would take the form of a collective defense arrangement within the terms of the united nations charter.  we have already established such a defense pact for the western hemisphere by the treaty of rio de janeiro.  the primary purpose of these agreements is to provide unmistakable proof of the joint determination of the free countries to resist armed attack from any quarter. every country participating in these arrangements must contribute all it can to the common defense.  if we can make it sufficiently clear, in advance, that any armed attack affecting our national security would be met with overwhelming force, the armed attack might never occur.  i hope soon to send to the senate a treaty respecting the north atlantic security plan.  in addition, we will provide military advice and equipment to free nations which will cooperate with us in the maintenance of peace and security.  fourth, we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas.  more than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. their food is inadequate. they are victims of disease. their economic life is primitive and stagnant. their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas.  for the first time in history, humanity posesses the knowledge and skill to relieve suffering of these people.  the united states is pre-eminent among nations in the development of industrial and scientific techniques. the material resources which we can afford to use for assistance of other peoples are limited. but our imponderable resources in technical knowledge are constantly growing and are inexhaustible.  i believe that we should make available to peace-loving peoples the benefits of our store of technical knowledge in order to help them realize their aspirations for a better life. and, in cooperation with other nations, we should foster capital investment in areas needing development.  our aim should be to help the free peoples of the world, through their own efforts, to produce more food, more clothing, more materials for housing, and more mechanical power to lighten their burdens.  we invite other countries to pool their technological resources in this undertaking. their contributions will be warmly welcomed. this should be a cooperative enterprise in which all nations work together through the united nations and its specialized agencies whenever practicable. it must be a worldwide effort for the achievement of peace, plenty, and freedom.  with the cooperation of business, private capital, agriculture, and labor in this country, this program can greatly increase the industrial activity in other nations and can raise substantially their standards of living.  such new economic developments must be devised and controlled to the benefit of the peoples of the areas in which they are established. guarantees to the investor must be balanced by guarantees in the interest of the people whose resources and whose labor go into these developments.  the old imperialism—exploitation for foreign profit—has no place in our plans. what we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair-dealing.  all countries, including our own, will greatly benefit from a constructive program for the better use of the world's human and natural resources. experience shows that our commerce with other countries expands as they progress industrially and economically.  greater production is the key to prosperity and peace. and the key to greater production is a wider and more vigorous application of modern scientific and technical knowledge.  only by helping the least fortunate of its members to help themselves can the human family achieve the decent, satisfying life that is the right of all people.  democracy alone can supply the vitalizing force to stir the peoples of the world into triumphant action, not only against their human oppressors, but also against their ancient enemies—hunger, misery, and despair.  on the basis of these four major courses of action we hope to help create the conditions that will lead eventually to personal freedom and happiness for all mankind.  if we are to be successful in carrying out these policies, it is clear that we must have continued prosperity in this country and we must keep ourselves strong.  slowly but surely we are weaving a world fabric of international security and growing prosperity.  we are aided by all who wish to live in freedom from fear—even by those who live today in fear under their own governments.  we are aided by all who want relief from lies and propaganda—those who desire truth and sincerity.  we are aided by all who desire self-government and a voice in deciding their own affairs.  we are aided by all who long for economic security—for the security and abundance that men in free societies can enjoy.  we are aided by all who desire freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to live their own lives for useful ends.  our allies are the millions who hunger and thirst after righteousness.  in due time, as our stability becomes manifest, as more and more nations come to know the benefits of democracy and to participate in growing abundance, i believe that those countries which now oppose us will abandon their delusions and join with the free nations of the world in a just settlement of international differences.  events have brought our american democracy to new influence and new responsibilities. they will test our courage, our devotion to duty, and our concept of liberty.  but i say to all men, what we have achieved in liberty, we will surpass in greater liberty.  steadfast in our faith in the almighty, we will advance toward a world where man's freedom is secure.  to that end we will devote our strength, our resources, and our firmness of resolve. with god's help, the future of mankind will be assured in a world of justice, harmony, and peace.  ",    mr vice president mr chief justice fellow citizens  i accept with humility the honor which the american people have conferred upon me i accept it with a resolve to do all that i can for the welfare of this nation and for the peace of the world  in performing the duties of my office i need the help and the prayers of every one of you i ask for your encouragement and for your support the tasks we face are difficult we can accomplish them only if we work together  each period of our national history has had its special challenges those that confront us now are as momentous as any in the past today marks the beginning not only of a new administration but of a period that will be eventful perhaps decisive for us and for the world  it may be our lot to experience and in a large measure bring about a major turning point in the long history of the human race the first half of this century has been marked by unprecedented and brutal attacks on the rights of man and by the two most frightful wars in history the supreme need of our time is for men to learn to live together in peace and harmony  the peoples of the earth face the future with grave uncertainty composed almost equally of great hopes and great fears in this time of doubt they look to the united states as never before for good will strength and wise leadership  it is fitting therefore that we take this occasion to proclaim to the world the essential principles of the faith by which we live and to declare our aims to all peoples  the american people stand firm in the faith which has inspired this nation from the beginning we believe that all men have a right to equal justice under law and equal opportunity to share in the common good we believe that all men have a right to freedom of thought and expression we believe that all men are created equal because they are created in the image of god  from this faith we will not be moved  the american people desire and are determined to work for a world in which all nations and all peoples are free to govern themselves as they see fit and to achieve a decent and satisfying life above all else our people desire and are determined to work for peace on earth—a just and lasting peace—based on genuine agreement freely arrived at by equals  in the pursuit of these aims the united states and other like-minded nations find themselves directly opposed by a regime with contrary aims and a totally different concept of life  that regime adheres to a false philosophy which purports to offer freedom security and greater opportunity to mankind misled by that philosophy many peoples have sacrificed their liberties only to learn to their sorrow that deceit and mockery poverty and tyranny are their reward  that false philosophy is communism  communism is based on the belief that man is so weak and inadequate that he is unable to govern himself and therefore requires the rule of strong masters  democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and intellectual capacity as well as the inalienable right to govern himself with reason and justice  communism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause punishment without trial and forced labor as the chattel of the state it decrees what information he shall receive what art he shall produce what leaders he shall follow and what thoughts he shall think  democracy maintains that government is established for the benefit of the individual and is charged with the responsibility of protecting the rights of the individual and his freedom in the exercise of those abilities of his  communism maintains that social wrongs can be corrected only by violence  democracy has proved that social justice can be achieved through peaceful change  communism holds that the world is so widely divided into opposing classes that war is inevitable  democracy holds that free nations can settle differences justly and maintain a lasting peace  these differences between communism and democracy do not concern the united states alone people everywhere are coming to realize that what is involved is material well-being human dignity and the right to believe in and worship god  i state these differences not to draw issues of belief as such but because the actions resulting from the communist philosophy are a threat to the efforts of free nations to bring about world recovery and lasting peace  since the end of hostilities the united states has invested its substance and its energy in a great constructive effort to restore peace stability and freedom to the world  we have sought no territory we have imposed our will on none we have asked for no privileges we would not extend to others  we have constantly and vigorously supported the united nations and related agencies as a means of applying democratic principles to international relations we have consistently advocated and relied upon peaceful settlement of disputes among nations  we have made every effort to secure agreement on effective international control of our most powerful weapon and we have worked steadily for the limitation and control of all armaments  we have encouraged by precept and example the expansion of world trade on a sound and fair basis  almost a year ago in company with 16 free nations of europe we launched the greatest cooperative economic program in history the purpose of that unprecedented effort is to invigorate and strengthen democracy in europe so that the free people of that continent can resume their rightful place in the forefront of civilization and can contribute once more to the security and welfare of the world  our efforts have brought new hope to all mankind we have beaten back despair and defeatism we have saved a number of countries from losing their liberty hundreds of millions of people all over the world now agree with us that we need not have war—that we can have peace  the initiative is ours  we are moving on with other nations to build an even stronger structure of international order and justice we shall have as our partners countries which no longer solely concerned with the problem of national survival are now working to improve the standards of living of all their people we are ready to undertake new projects to strengthen a free world  in the coming years our program for peace and freedom will emphasize four major courses of action  first we will continue to give unfaltering support to the united nations and related agencies and we will continue to search for ways to strengthen their authority and increase their effectiveness we believe that the united nations will be strengthened by the new nations which are being formed in lands now advancing toward self-government under democratic principles  second we will continue our programs for world economic recovery  this means first of all that we must keep our full weight behind the european recovery program we are confident of the success of

foster capital investment in areas need development  our aim should be to help the free people of the world through their own efforts to produce more food more clothe more materials for house and more mechanical power to lighten their burden  we invite other countries to pool their technological resources in this undertake their contributions will be warmly welcome this should be a cooperative enterprise in which all nations work together through the unite nations and its specialize agencies whenever practicable it must be a worldwide effort for the achievement of peace plenty and freedom  with the cooperation of business private capital agriculture and labor in this country this program can greatly increase the industrial activity in other nations and can raise substantially their standards of live  such new economic developments must be devise and control to the benefit of the people of the areas in which they be establish guarantee to the investor must be balance by guarantee in the interest of the people whose resources and whose labor go into these developments  the old imperialism—exploitation for foreign profit—has no place in our plan what we envisage be a program of development base on the concepts of democratic fair-dealing  all countries include our own will greatly benefit from a constructive program for the better use of the world human and natural resources experience show that our commerce with other countries expand as they progress industrially and economically  greater production be the key to prosperity and peace and the key to greater production be a wider and more vigorous application of modern scientific and technical knowledge  only by help the least fortunate of its members to help themselves can the human family achieve the decent satisfy life that be the right of all people  democracy alone can supply the vitalize force to stir the people of the world into triumphant action not only against their human oppressors but also against their ancient enemies—hunger misery and despair  on the basis of these four major course of action we hope to help create the condition that will lead eventually to personal freedom and happiness for all mankind  if we be to be successful in carry out these policies it be clear that we must have continue prosperity in this country and we must keep ourselves strong  slowly but surely we be weave a world fabric of international security and grow prosperity  we be aid by all who wish to live in freedom from fear—even by those who live today in fear under their own governments  we be aid by all who want relief from lie and propaganda—those who desire truth and sincerity  we be aid by all who desire self-government and a voice in decide their own affairs  we be aid by all who long for economic security—for the security and abundance that men in free societies can enjoy  we be aid by all who desire freedom of speech freedom of religion and freedom to live their own live for useful end  our ally be the millions who hunger and thirst after righteousness  in due time as our stability become manifest as more and more nations come to know the benefit of democracy and to participate in grow abundance i believe that those countries which now oppose us will abandon their delusions and join with the free nations of the world in a just settlement of international differences  events have bring our american democracy to new influence and new responsibilities they will test our courage our devotion to duty and our concept of liberty  but i say to all men what we have achieve in liberty we will surpass in greater liberty  steadfast in our faith in the almighty we will advance toward a world where man freedom be secure  to that end we will devote our strength our resources and our firmness of resolve with god help the future of mankind will be assure in a world of justice harmony and peace  ,        chief justice fellow citizens   accept  humility  honor   american people

expression.', 'we believe that all men are created equal because they are created in the image of god.', 'from this faith we will not be moved.', 'the american people desire, and are determined to work for, a world in which all nations and all peoples are free to govern themselves as they see fit, and to achieve a decent and satisfying life.', 'above all else, our people desire, and are determined to work for, peace on earth—a just and lasting peace—based on genuine agreement freely arrived at by equals.', 'in the pursuit of these aims, the united states and other like-minded nations find themselves directly opposed by a regime with contrary aims and a totally different concept of life.', 'that regime adheres to a false philosophy which purports to offer freedom, security, and greater opportunity to mankind.', 'misled by that philosophy, many peoples have sacrificed their liberties only to learn to their sorrow that deceit and mockery, poverty and tyranny, are their reward.', 'that false philosophy is communism.', 'communism is based on the belief that man is so weak and inadequate that he is unable to govern himself, and therefore requires the rule of strong masters.', 'democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and intellectual capacity, as well as the inalienable right, to govern himself with reason and justice.', 'communism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause, punishment without trial, and forced labor as the chattel of the state.', 'it decrees what information he shall receive, what art he shall produce, what leaders he shall follow, and what thoughts he shall think.', 'democracy maintains that government is established for the benefit of the individual, and is charged with the responsibility of protecting the rights of the individual and his freedom in the exercise of those abilities of his.', 'communism maintains that social wrongs can be corrected only by violence.', 'democracy has proved that social justice can be achieved through peaceful change.', 'communism holds that the world is so widely divided into opposing classes that war is inevitable.', 'democracy holds that free nations can settle differences justly and maintain a lasting peace.', 'these differences between communism and democracy do not concern the united states alone.', 'people everywhere are coming to realize that what is involved is material well-being, human dignity, and the right to believe in and worship god.', 'i state these differences, not to draw issues of belief as such, but because the actions resulting from the communist philosophy are a threat to the efforts of free nations to bring about world recovery and lasting peace.', 'since the end of hostilities, the united states has invested its substance and its energy in a great constructive effort to restore peace, stability, and freedom to the world.', 'we have sought no territory.', 'we have imposed our will on none.', 'we have asked for no privileges we would not extend to others.', 'we have constantly and vigorously supported the united nations and related agencies as a means of applying democratic principles to international relations.', 'we have consistently advocated and relied upon peaceful settlement of disputes among nations.', 'we have made every effort to secure agreement on effective international control of our most powerful weapon, and we have worked steadily for the limitation and control of all armaments.', 'we have encouraged, by precept and example, the expansion of world trade on a sound and fair basis.', 'almost a year ago, in company with 16 free nations of europe, we launched the greatest cooperative economic program in history.', 'the purpose of that unprecedented effort is to invigorate and strengthen democracy in europe, so that the free people of that continent can resume their rightful place in the forefront of civilization and can contribute once more to the security and welfare of the world.', 'our efforts have brought new hope to all mankind.', 'we have beaten back despair and defeatism.', 'we have saved a number of countries from losing their liberty.', 'hundreds of millions of people all over the world now agree with us, that we need not have war—that we can have peace.', 'the initiative is ours.', 'we are moving on with other nations to build an even stronger structure of international order and justice.', 'we shall have as our partners countries which, no longer solely concerned with the problem of national survival, are now working to improve the standards of living of all their people.', 'we are ready to undertake new projects to strengthen a free world.', 'in the coming years, our program for peace and freedom will emphasize four major courses of action.', 'first, we will continue to give unfaltering support to the united nations and related agencies, and we will continue to search for ways to strengthen their authority and increase their effectiveness.', 'we believe that the united nations will be strengthened by the new nations which are being formed in lands now advancing toward self-government under democratic principles.', 'second, we will continue our programs for world economic recovery.', 'this means, first of all, that we must keep our full weight behind the european recovery program.', 'we are confident of the success of this major venture in world recovery.', 'we believe that our partners in this effort will achieve the status of self-supporting nations once again.', 'in addition, we must carry out our plans for reducing the barriers to world trade and increasing its volume.', 'economic recovery and peace itself depend on increased world trade.', 'third, we will strengthen freedom-loving nations against the dangers of aggression.', 'we are now working out with a number of countries a joint agreement designed to strengthen the security of the north atlantic area.', 'such an agreement would take the form of a collective defense arrangement within the terms of the united nations charter.', 'we have already established such a defense pact for the western hemisphere by the treaty of rio de janeiro.', 'the primary purpose of these agreements is to provide unmistakable proof of the joint determination of the free countries to resist armed attack from any quarter.', 'every country participating in these arrangements must contribute all it can to the common defense.', 'if we can make it sufficiently clear, in advance, that any armed attack affecting our national security would be met with overwhelming force, the armed attack might never occur.', 'i hope soon to send to the senate a treaty respecting the north atlantic security plan.', 'in addition, we will provide military advice and equipment to free nations which will cooperate with us in the maintenance of peace and security.', 'fourth, we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas.', 'more than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery.', 'their food is inadequate.', 'they are victims of disease.', 'their economic life is primitive and stagnant.', 'their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas.', 'for the first time in history, humanity posesses the knowledge and skill to relieve suffering of these people.', 'the united states is pre-eminent among nations in the development of industrial and scientific techniques.', 'the material resources which we can afford to use for assistance of other peoples are limited.', 'but our imponderable resources in technical knowledge are constantly growing and are inexhaustible.', 'i believe that we should make available to peace-loving peoples the benefits of our store of technical knowledge in order to help them realize their aspirations for a better life.', 'and, in cooperation with other nations, we should foster capital investment in areas needing development.', 'our aim should be to help the free peoples of the world, through their own efforts, to produce more food, more clothing, more materials for housing, and more mechanical power to lighten their burdens.', 'we invite other countries to pool their technological resources in this undertaking.', 'their contributions will be warmly welcomed.', 'this should be a cooperative enterprise in which all nations work together through the united nations and its specialized agencies whenever practicable.', 'it must be a worldwide effort for the achievement of peace, plenty, and freedom.', 'with the cooperation of business, private capital, agriculture, and labor in this country, this program can greatly increase the industrial activity in other nations and can raise substantially their standards of living.', 'such new economic developments must be devised and controlled to the benefit of the peoples of the areas in which they are established.', 'guarantees to the investor must be balanced by guarantees in the interest of the people whose resources and whose labor go into these developments.', 'the old imperialism—exploitation for foreign profit—has no place in our plans.', 'what we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair-dealing.', ""all countries, including our own, will greatly benefit from a constructive program for the better use of the world's human and natural resources."", 'experience shows that our commerce with other countries expands as they progress industrially and economically.', 'greater production is the key to prosperity and peace.', 'and the key to greater production is a wider and more vigorous application of modern scientific and technical knowledge.', 'only by helping the least fortunate of its members to help themselves can the human family achieve the decent, satisfying life that is the right of all people.', 'democracy alone can supply the vitalizing force to stir the peoples of the world into triumphant action, not only against their human oppressors, but also against their ancient enemies—hunger, misery, and despair.', 'on the basis of these four major courses of action we hope to help create the conditions that will lead eventually to personal freedom and happiness for all mankind.', 'if we are to be successful in carrying out these policies, it is clear that we must have continued prosperity in this country and we must keep ourselves strong.', 'slowly but surely we are weaving a world fabric of international security and growing prosperity.', 'we are aided by all who wish to live in freedom from fear—even by those who live today in fear under their own governments.', 'we are aided by all who want relief from lies and propaganda—those who desire truth and sincerity.', 'we are aided by all who desire self-government and a voice in deciding their own affairs.', 'we are aided by all who long for economic security—for the security and abundance that men in free societies can enjoy.', 'we are aided by all who desire freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to live their own lives for useful ends.', 'our allies are the millions who hunger and thirst after righteousness.', 'in due time, as our stability becomes manifest, as more and more nations come to know the benefits of democracy and to participate in growing abundance, i believe that those countries which now oppose us will abandon their delusions and join with the free nations of the world in a just settlement of international differences.', 'events have brought our american democracy to new influence and new responsibilities.', 'they will test our courage, our devotion to duty, and our concept of liberty.', 'but i say to all men, what we have achieved in liberty, we will surpass in greater liberty.', ""steadfast in our faith in the almighty, we will advance toward a world where man's freedom is secure."", 'to that end we will devote our strength, our resources, and our firmness of resolve.', ""with god's help, the future of mankind will be assured in a world of justice, harmony, and peace.""]","['chief', 'justice', 'fellow', 'citizens', 'accept', 'humility', 'honor', 'american', 'people', 'confer', 'upon', 'accept', 'resolve', 'welfare', 'nation',

Franklin D. Roosevelt,"January 20, 1945","
      
      Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, my friends:
You will understand and, I believe, agree with my wish that the form of this inauguration be simple and its words brief.
We Americans of today, together with our allies, are passing through a period of supreme test. It is a test of our courage—of our resolve—of our wisdom—of our essential democracy.
If we meet that test—successfully and honorably—we shall perform a service of historic importance which men and women and children will honor throughout all time.
As I stand here today, having taken the solemn oath of office in the presence of my fellow countrymen—in the presence of our God—I know that it
is America's purpose that we shall not fail.
In the days and the years that are to come, we shall work for ajust and honorable peace, a durable peace, as today we work and fight for total victory in war.
We can and we will achieve such a peace.
We shall strive for perfection. We shall not achieve it immediately—but we still shall strive. We may make mistakes—but they must never be mistakes which result from faintness of heart or abandonment of moral
principle.
I remember that my old schoolmaster, Dr. Peabody, said in days that seemed to us then to be secure and untroubled, ""Things in life will not always run smoothly. Sometimes we will be rising toward the heights—then all will seem to reverse itself and start downward. The great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is forever upward; that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and the valleys of the centuries always has an upward trend.""
Our Constitution of 1787 was not a perfect instrument; it is not perfect yet. But it provided a firm base upon which all manner of men, of all races and colors and creeds, could build our solid structure of democracy.
Today, in this year of war, 1945, we have learned lessons—at a fearful cost—and we shall profit by them.
We have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace; that our own well-being is dependent on the well-being of other Nations, far away. We have learned that we must live as men and not as ostriches, nor as dogs in the manger.
We have learned to be citizens of the world, members of the human community.
We have learned the simple truth, as Emerson said, that, ""The only way to have a friend is to be one.""
We can gain no lasting peace if we approach it with suspicion and mistrust or with fear. We can gain it only if we proceed with the understanding and the confidence and the courage which flow from conviction.
The Almighty God has blessed our land in many ways. He has given our people stout hearts and strong arms with which to strike mighty blows for freedom and truth. He has given to our country a faith which has become the hope of all peoples in an anguished world.
So we pray to Him now for the vision to see our way clearly to see the way that leads to a better life for ourselves and for all our fellow men—and to the achievement of His will to peace on earth.

      On each national day of Inauguration since 1789, the people have renewed their sense of dedication to the United States.

In Washington's day the task of the people was to create and weld together a Nation.

In Lincoln's day the task of the people was to preserve that Nation from disruption from within.

In this day the task of the people is to save that Nation and its institutions from disruption from without.

To us there has come a time, in the midst of swift happenings, to pause for a moment and take stock—to recall what our place in history has been, and to rediscover what we are and what we may be. If we do not, we risk the real peril of isolation, the real peril of inaction.

Lives of Nations are determined not by the count of years, but by the lifetime of the human spirit. The life of a man is threescore years and ten: a little more, a little less. The life of a Nation is the fullness of the measure of its will to live.

There are men who doubt this. There are men who believe that democracy, as a form of government and a frame of life, is limited or measured by a kind of mystical and artificial fate that, for some unexplained reason, tyranny and slavery have become the surging wave of the future—and that freedom is an ebbing tide.

But we Americans know that this is not true.

Eight years ago, when the life of this Republic seemed frozen by a fatalistic terror, we proved that this is not true. We were in the midst of shock—but we acted. We acted quickly, boldly, decisively.

These later years have been living years—fruitful years for the people of this democracy. For they have brought to us greater security and, I hope, a better understanding that life's ideals are to be measured in other than material things.

Most vital to our present and to our future is this experience of a democracy which successfully survived crisis at home; put away many evil things; built new structures on enduring lines; and, through it all, maintained the fact of its democracy.

For action has been taken within the three-way framework of the Constitution of the United States. The coordinate branches of the Government continue freely to function. The Bill of Rights remains inviolate. The freedom of elections is wholly maintained. Prophets of the downfall of American democracy have seen their dire predictions come to naught.

No, democracy is not dying.

We know it because we have seen it revive—and grow.

We know it cannot die—because it is built on the unhampered
initiative of individual men and women joined together in a common
enterprise—an enterprise undertaken and carried through by the free expression of a free majority.

We know it because democracy alone, of all forms of government, enlists the full force of men's enlightened will.

We know it because democracy alone has constructed an unlimited civilization capable of infinite progress in the improvement of human life.

We know it because, if we look below the surface, we sense it still spreading on every continent—for it is the most humane, the most advanced, and in the end the most unconquerable of all forms of human society.

A Nation, like a person, has a body—a body that must be fed and clothed and housed, invigorated and rested, in a manner that measures up to the standards of our time.

A Nation, like a person, has a mind—a mind that must be kept informed and alert, that must know itself, that understands the hopes and the needs of its neighbors—all the other Nations that live within the narrowing circle of the world.

A Nation, like a person, has something deeper, something more permanent, something larger than the sum of all its parts. It is that something which matters most to its future—which calls forth the most sacred guarding of its present.

It is a thing for which we find it difficult—even impossible to hit upon a single, simple word.

And yet, we all understand what it is—the spirit-the faith of America. It is the product of centuries. It was born in the multitudes of those who came from many lands-some of high degree, but mostly plain people—who sought here, early and late, to find freedom more freely.

The democratic aspiration is no mere recent phase in human history. It is human history. It permeated the ancient life of early peoples. It blazed anew in the Middle Ages. It was written in Magna Charta.

In the Americas its impact has been irresistible. America has been the New World in all tongues, and to all peoples, not because this continent was a new-found land, but because all those who came here believed they could create upon this continent a new life—a life that should be new in freedom.

Its vitality was written into our own Mayflower Compact, into the Declaration of Independence, into the Constitution of the United States, into the Gettysburg Address.

Those who first came here to carry out the longings of their spirit, and the millions who followed, and the stock that sprang from them—all have moved forward constantly and consistently toward an ideal which in itself has gained stature and clarity with each generation.

The hopes of the Republic cannot forever tolerate either undeserved poverty or self-serving wealth.

We know that we still have far to go; that we must more greatly build the security and the opportunity and the knowledge of every citizen, in the measure justified by the resources and the capacity of the land.

But it is not enough to achieve these purposes alone. It is not enough to clothe and feed the body of this Nation, to instruct, and inform its mind. For there is also the spirit. And of the three, the greatest is the spirit.

Without the body and the mind, as all men know, the Nation could not live.

But if the spirit of America were killed, even though the Nation's body and mind, constricted in an alien world, lived on, the America we know would have perished.

That spirit—that faith—speaks to us in our daily lives in ways often unnoticed, because they seem so obvious. It speaks to us here in the Capital of the Nation. It speaks to us through the processes of governing in the sovereignties of 48 States. It speaks to us in our counties, in our cities, in our towns, and in our villages. It speaks to us from the other Nations of the hemisphere, and from those across the seas—the enslaved, as well as the free. Sometimes we fail to hear or heed these voices of freedom because to us the privilege of our freedom is such an old, old story.

The destiny of America was proclaimed in words of prophecy spoken by our first President in his first Inaugural in 1789—words almost directed, it
would seem, to this year of 1941: ""The preservation of the sacred fire of
liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly
considered. . . deeply, . . . finally, staked on the experiment intrusted to
the hands of the American people.""

If you and I in this later day lose that sacred fire—if we let it be smothered with doubt and fear—then we shall reject the destiny which Washington strove so valiantly and so triumphantly to establish. The preservation of the spirit and faith of the Nation does, and will, furnish the highest justification for every sacrifice that we may make in the cause of national defense.

In the face of great perils never before encountered, our strong purpose is to protect and to perpetuate the integrity of democracy.

For this we muster the spirit of America, and the faith of America.

We do not retreat. We are not content to stand still. As Americans, we go forward, in the service of our country, by the will of God.

determine not by the count of years but by the lifetime of the human spirit the life of a man be threescore years and ten a little more a little less the life of a nation be the fullness of the measure of its will to live there be men who doubt this there be men who believe that democracy as a form of government and a frame of life be limit or measure by a kind of mystical and artificial fate that for some unexplained reason tyranny and slavery have become the surge wave of the future—and that freedom be an ebb tide but we americans know that this be not true eight years ago when the life of this republic seem freeze by a fatalistic terror we prove that this be not true we be in the midst of shock—but we act we act quickly boldly decisively these later years have be live years—fruitful years for the people of this democracy for they have bring to us greater security and i hope a better understand that life ideals be to be measure in other than material things most vital to our present and to our future be this experience of a democracy which successfully survive crisis at home put away many evil things build new structure on endure line and through it all maintain the fact of its democracy for action have be take within the three-way framework of the constitution of the unite state the coordinate branch of the government continue freely to function the bill of right remain inviolate the freedom of elections be wholly maintain prophets of the downfall of american democracy have see their dire predictions come to naught no democracy be not die we know it because we have see it revive—and grow we know it cannot die—because it be build on the unhampered  initiative of individual men and women join together in a common  enterprise—an enterprise undertake and carry through by the free expression of a free majority we know it because democracy alone of all form of government enlist the full force of men enlighten will we know it because democracy alone have construct an unlimited civilization capable of infinite progress in the improvement of human life we know it because if we look below the surface we sense it still spread on every continent—for it be the most humane the most advance and in the end the most unconquerable of all form of human society a nation like a person have a body—a body that must be feed and clothe and house invigorate and rest in a manner that measure up to the standards of our time a nation like a person have a mind—a mind that must be keep inform and alert that must know itself that understand the hop and the need of its neighbors—all the other nations that live within the narrow circle of the world a nation like a person have something deeper something more permanent something larger than the sum of all its part it be that something which matter most to its future—which call forth the most sacred guard of its present it be a thing for which we find it difficult—even impossible to hit upon a single simple word and yet we all understand what it is—the spirit-the faith of america it be the product of centuries it be bear in the multitudes of those who come from many lands-some of high degree but mostly plain people—who seek here early and late to find freedom more freely the democratic aspiration be no mere recent phase in human history it be human history it permeate the ancient life of early people it blaze anew in the middle age it be write in magna charta in the americas its impact have be irresistible america have be the new world in all tongue and to all people not because this continent be a new-found land but because all those who come here believe they could create upon this continent a new life—a life that should be new in freedom its vitality be write into our own mayflower compact into the declaration of independence into the constitution of the unite state into the gettysburg address those who first come here to carry out the long of their spirit and the millions who follow and the stock that spring from them—all have move forward constantly and consistently toward an ideal which in itself have gain stature and clarity with each generation the hop of the republic cannot forever tolerate either undeserved poverty or self-serving wealth we know that we still have far to go that we must more greatly build the security and the opportunity and the knowledge of every citizen in the measure justify by the resources and the capacity of the land but it be not enough to achieve these purpose alone it be not enough to clothe and fee the body of this nation to instruct and inform its mind for there be also the spirit and of the three the greatest be the spirit without the body and the mind as all men know the nation could not live but if the spirit of america be kill even though the nation body and mind constrict in an alien world live on the america we know would have perish that spirit—that faith—speaks to us in our daily live in ways often unnoticed because they seem so obvious it speak to us here in the capital of the nation it speak to us through the process of govern in the sovereignties of 48 state it speak to us in our counties in our cities in our towns and in our villages it speak to us from the other nations of the hemisphere and from those across the seas—the enslave as well as the free sometimes we fail to hear or heed these voice of freedom because to us the privilege of our freedom be such an old old story the destiny of america be proclaim in word of prophecy speak by our first president in his first

deeply    finally stake on the experiment intrust to  the hand of the american people"" if you and i in this later day lose that sacred fire—if we let it be smother with doubt and fear—then we shall reject the destiny which washington strive so valiantly and so triumphantly to establish the preservation of the spirit and faith of the nation do and will furnish the highest justification for every sacrifice that we may make in the cause of national defense in the face of great peril never before encounter our strong purpose be to protect and to perpetuate the integrity of democracy for this we

Franklin D. Roosevelt,"January 20, 1937","
      
      When four years ago we met to inaugurate President, the Republic, single-minded in anxiety, stood in spirit here. We dedicated ourselves to the fulfillment of a vision—to speed the time when there would be for all the people that security and peace essential to the pursuit of happiness. We of the Republic pledged ourselves to drive from the temple of our ancient faith those who had profaned it; to end by action, tireless and unafraid, the stagnation and despair of that day. We did those first things first.
Our covenant with ourselves did not stop there. Instinctively we recognized a deeper need—the need to find through government the instrument of our united purpose to solve for the individual the ever-rising problems of a complex civilization. Repeated attempts at their solution without the aid of government had left us baffled and bewildered. For, without that aid, we had been unable to create those moral controls over the services of science which are necessary to make science a useful servant instead of a ruthless master of mankind. To do this we knew that we must find practical controls over blind economic forces and blindly selfish men.
We of the Republic sensed the truth that democratic government has innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered inevitable, to solve problems once considered unsolvable. We would not admit that we could not find a way to master economic epidemics just as, after centuries of fatalistic suffering, we had found a way to master epidemics of disease. We refused to leave the problems of our common welfare to be solved by the winds of chance and the hurricanes of disaster.
In this we Americans were discovering no wholly new truth; we were writing a new chapter in our book of self-government.
This year marks the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Constitutional Convention which made us a nation. At that Convention our forefathers found the way out of the chaos which followed the Revolutionary War; they created a strong government with powers of united action sufficient then and now to solve problems utterly beyond individual or local solution. A century and a half ago they established the Federal Government in order to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to the American people.
Today we invoke those same powers of government to achieve the same objectives.
Four years of new experience have not belied our historic instinct. They hold out the clear hope that government within communities, government within the separate States, and government of the United States can do the things the times require, without yielding its democracy. Our tasks in the last four years did not force democracy to take a holiday.
Nearly all of us recognize that as intricacies of human relationships increase, so power to govern them also must increase power to stop evil; power to do good. The essential democracy of our Nation and the safety of our people depend not upon the absence of power, but upon lodging it with those whom the people can change or continue at stated intervals through an honest and free system of elections. The Constitution of 1787 did not make our democracy impotent.
In fact, in these last four years, we have made the exercise of all power more democratic; for we have begun to bring private autocratic powers into their proper subordination to the public's government. The legend that they were invincible above and beyond the processes of a democracy has been shattered. They have been challenged and beaten.
Our progress out of the depression is obvious. But that is not all that you and I mean by the new order of things. Our pledge was not merely to do a patchwork job with second-hand materials. By using the new materials of social justice we have undertaken to erect on the old foundations a more enduring structure for the better use of future generations.
In that purpose we have been helped by achievements of mind and spirit. Old truths have been relearned; untruths have been unlearned. We have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals; we know now that it is bad economics. Out of the collapse of a prosperity whose builders boasted their practicality has come the conviction that in the long run economic morality pays. We are beginning to wipe out the line that divides the practical from the ideal; and in so doing we are fashioning an instrument of unimagined power for the establishment of a morally better world.
This new understanding undermines the old admiration of worldly success as such. We are beginning to abandon our tolerance of the abuse of power by those who betray for profit the elementary decencies of life.
In this process evil things formerly accepted will not be so easily condoned. Hard-headedness will not so easily excuse hardheartedness. We are moving toward an era of good feeling. But we realize that there can be no era of good feeling save among men of good will.
For these reasons I am justified in believing that the greatest change we have witnessed has been the change in the moral climate of America.
Among men of good will, science and democracy together offer an ever-richer life and ever-larger satisfaction to the individual. With this change in our moral climate and our rediscovered ability to improve our economic order, we have set our feet upon the road of enduring progress.
Shall we pause now and turn our back upon the road that lies ahead? Shall we call this the promised land? Or, shall we continue on our way? For ""each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth.""
Many voices are heard as we face a great decision. Comfort says, ""Tarry a while."" Opportunism says, ""This is a good spot."" Timidity asks, ""How difficult is the road ahead?""
True, we have come far from the days of stagnation and despair. Vitality has been preserved. Courage and confidence have been restored. Mental and moral horizons have been extended.
But our present gains were won under the pressure of more than ordinary circumstance. Advance became imperative under the goad of fear and suffering. The times were on the side of progress.
To hold to progress today, however, is more difficult. Dulled conscience, irresponsibility, and ruthless self-interest already reappear. Such symptoms of prosperity may become portents of disaster! Prosperity already tests the persistence of our progressive purpose.
Let us ask again: Have we reached the goal of our vision of that fourth day of March, 1933? Have we found our happy valley?
I see a great nation, upon a great continent, blessed with a great wealth of natural resources. Its hundred and thirty million people are at peace among themselves; they are making their country a good neighbor among the nations. I see a United States which can demonstrate that, under democratic methods of government, national wealth can be translated into a spreading volume of human comforts hitherto unknown, and the lowest standard of living can be raised far above the level of mere subsistence.
But here is the challenge to our democracy: In this nation I see tens of millions of its citizens—a substantial part of its whole population—who at this very moment are denied the greater part of what the very lowest standards of today call the necessities of life.
I see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hangs over them day by day.
I see millions whose daily lives in city and on farm continue under conditions labeled indecent by a so-called polite society half a century ago.
I see millions denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children.
I see millions lacking the means to buy the products of farm and factory and by their poverty denying work and productiveness to many other millions.
I see one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.
It is not in despair that I paint you that picture. I paint it for you in hope—because the Nation, seeing and understanding the injustice in it, proposes to paint it out. We are determined to make every American citizen the subject of his country's interest and concern; and we will never regard any faithful, law-abiding group within our borders as superfluous. The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.
If I know aught of the spirit and purpose of our Nation, we will not listen to Comfort, Opportunism, and Timidity. We will carry on.
Overwhelmingly, we of the Republic are men and women of good will; men and women who have more than warm hearts of dedication; men and women who have cool heads and willing hands of practical purpose as well. They will insist that every agency of popular government use effective instruments to carry out their will.
Government is competent when all who compose it work as trustees for the whole people. It can make constant progress when it keeps abreast of all the facts. It can obtain justified support and legitimate criticism when the people receive true information of all that government does.
If I know aught of the will of our people, they will demand that these conditions of effective government shall be created and maintained. They will demand a nation uncorrupted by cancers of injustice and, therefore, strong among the nations in its example of the will to peace.
Today we reconsecrate our country to long-cherished ideals in a suddenly changed civilization. In every land there are always at work forces that drive men apart and forces that draw men together. In our personal ambitions we are individualists. But in our seeking for economic and political progress as a nation, we all go up, or else we all go down, as one people.
To maintain a democracy of effort requires a vast amount of patience in dealing with differing methods, a vast amount of humility. But out of the confusion of many voices rises an understanding of dominant public need. Then political leadership can voice common ideals, and aid in their realization.
In taking again the oath of office as President of the United States, I assume the solemn obligation of leading the American people forward along the road over which they have chosen to advance.
While this duty rests upon me I shall do my utmost to speak their purpose and to do their will, seeking Divine guidance to help us each and every one to give light to them that sit in darkness and to guide our feet into the way of peace.

    ",Inaugural Address,Democrat,0,1937,"    When four years ago we met to inaugurate President, the Republic, single-minded in anxiety, stood in spirit here. We dedicated ourselves to the fulfillment of a vision—to speed the time when there would be for all the people that security and peace essential to the pursuit of happiness. We of the Republic pledged ourselves to drive from the temple of our ancient faith those who had profaned it; to end by action, tireless and unafraid, the stagnation and despair of that day. We did those first things first.  Our covenant with ourselves did not stop there. Instinctively we recognized a deeper need—the need to find through government the instrument of our united purpose to solve for the individual the ever-rising problems of a complex civilization. Repeated attempts at their solution without the aid of government had left us baffled and bewildered. For, without that aid, we had been unable to create those moral controls over the services of science which are necessary to make science a useful servant instead of a ruthless master of mankind. To do this we knew that we must find practical controls over blind economic forces and blindly selfish men.  We of the Republic sensed the truth that democratic government has innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered inevitable, to solve problems once considered unsolvable. We would not admit that we could not find a way to master economic epidemics just as, after centuries of fatalistic suffering, we had found a way to master epidemics of disease. We refused to leave the problems of our common welfare to be solved by the winds of chance and the hurricanes of disaster.  In this we Americans were discovering no wholly new truth; we were writing a new chapter in our book of self-government.  This year marks the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Constitutional Convention which made us a nation. At that Convention our forefathers found the way out of the chaos which followed the Revolutionary War; they created a strong government with powers of united action sufficient then and now to solve problems utterly beyond individual or local solution. A century and a half ago they established the Federal Government in order to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to the American people.  Today we invoke those same powers of government to achieve the same objectives.  Four years of new experience have not belied our historic instinct. They hold out the clear hope that government within communities, government within the separate States, and government of the United States can do the things the times require, without yielding its democracy. Our tasks in the last four years did not force democracy to take a holiday.  Nearly all of us recognize that as intricacies of human relationships increase, so power to govern them also must increase power to stop evil; power to do good. The essential democracy of our Nation and the safety of our people depend not upon the absence of power, but upon lodging it with those whom the people can change or continue at stated intervals through an honest and free system of elections. The Constitution of 1787 did not make our democracy impotent.  In fact, in these last four years, we have made the exercise of all power more democratic; for we have begun to bring private autocratic powers into their proper subordination to the public's government. The legend that they were invincible above and beyond the processes of a democracy has been shattered. They have been challenged and beaten.  Our progress out of the depression is obvious. But that is not all that you and I mean by the new order of things. Our pledge was not merely to do a patchwork job with second-hand materials. By using the new materials of social justice we have undertaken to erect on the old foundations a more enduring structure for the better use of future generations.  In that purpose we have been helped by achievements of mind and spirit. Old truths have been relearned; untruths have been unlearned. We have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals; we know now that it is bad economics. Out of the collapse of a prosperity whose builders boasted their practicality has come the conviction that in the long run economic morality pays. We are beginning to wipe out the line that divides the practical from the ideal; and in so doing we are fashioning an instrument of unimagined power for the establishment of a morally better world.  This new understanding undermines the old admiration of worldly success as such. We are beginning to abandon our tolerance of the abuse of power by those who betray for profit the elementary decencies of life.  In this process evil things formerly accepted will not be so easily condoned. Hard-headedness will not so easily excuse hardheartedness. We are moving toward an era of good feeling. But we realize that there can be no era of good feeling save among men of good will.  For these reasons I am justified in believing that the greatest change we have witnessed has been the change in the moral climate of America.  Among men of good will, science and democracy together offer an ever-richer life and ever-larger satisfaction to the individual. With this change in our moral climate and our rediscovered ability to improve our economic order, we have set our feet upon the road of enduring progress.  Shall we pause now and turn our back upon the road that lies ahead? Shall we call this the promised land? Or, shall we continue on our way? For ""each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth.""  Many voices are heard as we face a great decision. Comfort says, ""Tarry a while."" Opportunism says, ""This is a good spot."" Timidity asks, ""How difficult is the road ahead?""  True, we have come far from the days of stagnation and despair. Vitality has been preserved. Courage and confidence have been restored. Mental and moral horizons have been extended.  But our present gains were won under the pressure of more than ordinary circumstance. Advance became imperative under the goad of fear and suffering. The times were on the side of progress.  To hold to progress today, however, is more difficult. Dulled conscience, irresponsibility, and ruthless self-interest already reappear. Such symptoms of prosperity may become portents of disaster! Prosperity already tests the persistence of our progressive purpose.  Let us ask again: Have we reached the goal of our vision of that fourth day of March, 1933? Have we found our happy valley?  I see a great nation, upon a great continent, blessed with a great wealth of natural resources. Its hundred and thirty million people are at peace among themselves; they are making their country a good neighbor among the nations. I see a United States which can demonstrate that, under democratic methods of government, national wealth can be translated into a spreading volume of human comforts hitherto unknown, and the lowest standard of living can be raised far above the level of mere subsistence.  But here is the challenge to our democracy: In this nation I see tens of millions of its citizens—a substantial part of its whole population—who at this very moment are denied the greater part of what the very lowest standards of today call the necessities of life.  I see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hangs over them day by day.  I see millions whose daily lives in city and on farm continue under conditions labeled indecent by a so-called polite society half a century ago.  I see millions denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children.  I see millions lacking the means to buy the products of farm and factory and by their poverty denying work and productiveness to many other millions.  I see one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.  It is not in despair that I paint you that picture. I paint it for you in hope—because the Nation, seeing and understanding the injustice in it, proposes to paint it out. We are determined to make every American citizen the subject of his country's interest and concern; and we will never regard any faithful, law-abiding group within our borders as superfluous. The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.  If I know aught of the spirit and purpose of our Nation, we will not listen to Comfort, Opportunism, and Timidity. We will carry on.  Overwhelmingly, we of the Republic are men and women of good will; men and women who have more than warm hearts of dedication; men and women who have cool heads and willing hands of practical purpose as well.

reached the goal of our vision of that fourth day of march 1933 have we found our happy valley  i see a great nation upon a great continent blessed with a great wealth of natural resources its hundred and thirty million people are at peace among themselves they are making their country a good neighbor among the nations i see a united states which can demonstrate that under democratic methods of government national wealth can be translated into a spreading volume of human comforts hitherto unknown and the lowest standard of living can be raised far above the level of mere subsistence  but here is the challenge to our democracy in this nation i see tens of millions of its citizens—a substantial part of its whole population—who at this very moment are denied the greater part of what the very lowest standards of today call the necessities of life  i see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hangs over them day by day  i see millions whose daily lives in city and on farm continue under conditions labeled indecent by a so-called polite society half a century ago  i see millions denied education recreation and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children  i see millions lacking the means to buy the products of farm and factory and by their poverty denying work and productiveness to many other millions  i see one-third of a nation ill-housed ill-clad ill-nourished  it is not in despair that i paint you that picture i paint it for you in hope—because the nation seeing and understanding the injustice in it proposes to paint it out we are determined to make every american citizen the subject of his country interest and concern and we will never regard any faithful law-abiding group within our borders as superfluous the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little  if i know aught of the spirit and purpose of our nation we will not listen to comfort opportunism and timidity we will carry on  overwhelmingly we of the republic are men and women of good will men and women who have more than warm hearts of dedication men and women who have cool heads and willing hands of practical purpose as well they will insist that every agency of popular government use effective instruments to carry out their will  government is competent when all who compose it work as trustees for the whole people it can make constant progress when it keeps abreast of all the facts it can obtain justified support and legitimate criticism when the people receive true information of all that government does  if i know aught of the will of our people they will demand that these conditions of effective government shall be created and maintained they will demand a nation uncorrupted by cancers of injustice and therefore strong among the nations in its example of the will to peace  today we reconsecrate our country to long-cherished ideals in a suddenly changed civilization in every land there are always at work forces that drive men apart and forces that draw men together in our personal ambitions we are individualists but in our seeking for economic and political progress as a nation we all go up or else we all go down as one people  to maintain a democracy of effort requires a vast amount of patience in dealing with differing methods a vast amount of humility but out of the confusion of many voices rises an understanding of dominant public need then political leadership can voice common ideals and aid in their realization  in taking again the oath of office as president of the united states i assume the solemn obligation of leading the american people forward along the road over which they have chosen to advance  while this duty rests upon me i shall do my utmost to speak their purpose and to do their will seeking divine guidance to help us each and every one to give light to them that sit in darkness and to guide our feet into the way of peace  ","    when four years ago we meet to inaugurate president the republic single-minded in anxiety stand in spirit here we dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of a vision—to speed the time when there would be for all the people that security and peace essential to the pursuit of happiness we of the republic pledge ourselves to drive from the temple of our ancient faith those who have profane it to end by action tireless and unafraid the stagnation and despair of that day we do those first things first  our covenant with ourselves do not stop there instinctively we recognize a deeper need—the need to find through government the instrument of our unite purpose to solve for the individual the ever-rising problems of a complex civilization repeat attempt at their solution without the aid of government have leave us baffle and bewilder for without that aid we have be unable to create those moral control over the service of science which be necessary to make science a useful servant instead of a ruthless master of mankind to do this we know that we must find practical control over blind economic force and blindly selfish men  we of the republic sense the truth that democratic government have innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once consider inevitable to solve problems once consider unsolvable we would not admit that we could not find a way to master economic epidemics just as after centuries of fatalistic suffer we have find a way to master epidemics of disease we refuse to leave the problems of our common welfare to be solve by the wind of chance and the hurricanes of disaster  in this we americans be discover no wholly new truth we be write a new chapter in our book of self-government  this year mark the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the constitutional convention which make us a nation at that convention our forefathers find the way out of the chaos which follow the revolutionary war they create a strong government with power of unite action sufficient then and now to solve problems utterly beyond individual or local solution a century and a half ago they establish the federal government in order to promote the general welfare and secure the bless of liberty to the american people  today we invoke those same power of government to achieve the same objectives  four years of new experience have not belie our historic instinct they hold out the clear hope that government within communities government within the separate state and government of the unite state can do the things the time require without yield its democracy our task in the last four years do not force democracy to take a holiday  nearly all of us recognize that as intricacies of human relationships increase so power to govern them also must increase power to stop evil power to do good the essential democracy of our nation and the safety of our people depend not upon the absence of power but upon lodge it with those whom the people can change or continue at state intervals through an honest and free system of elections the constitution of 1787 do not make our democracy impotent  in fact in these last four years we have make the exercise of all power more democratic for we have begin to bring private autocratic power into their proper subordination to the public government the legend that they be invincible above and beyond the process of a democracy have be shatter they have be challenge and beat  our progress out of the depression be obvious but that be not all that you and i mean by the new order of things our pledge be not merely to do a patchwork job with second-hand materials by use the new materials of social justice we have undertake to erect on the old foundations a more endure structure for the better use of future generations  in that purpose we have be help by achievements of mind and spirit old truths have be relearn untruths have be unlearn we have always know that heedless self-interest be bad morals we know now that it be bad economics out of the collapse of a prosperity whose builders boast their practicality have come the conviction that in the long run economic morality pay we be begin to wipe out the line that divide the practical from the ideal and in so do we be fashion an instrument of unimagined power for the establishment of a morally better world  this new understand undermine the old admiration of worldly success as such we be begin to abandon our tolerance of the abuse of power by those who betray for profit the elementary decencies of life  in this process evil things formerly accept will not be so easily condone hard-headedness will not so easily excuse hardheartedness we be move toward an era of good feel but we realize that there can be no era of good feel save among men of good will  for these reason i be justify in believe that the greatest change we have witness have be the change in the moral climate of america  among men of good will science and democracy together offer an ever-richer life and ever-larger satisfaction to the individual with this change in our moral climate and our rediscover ability to improve our economic order we have set our feet upon the road of endure progress  shall we pause now and turn our back upon the road that lie ahead shall we call this the promise land or shall we continue on our way for ""each age be a dream that be die or one that be come to birth""  many voice be hear as we face a great decision comfort say ""tarry a while"" opportunism say ""this be a good spot"" timidity ask ""how difficult be the road ahead""  true we have come far from the days of stagnation and despair

of a vision—to speed the time when there would be for all the people that security and peace essential to the pursuit of happiness.', 'we of the republic pledged ourselves to drive from the temple of our ancient faith those who had profaned it; to end by action, tireless and unafraid, the stagnation and despair of that day.', 'we did those first things first.', 'our covenant with ourselves did not stop there.', 'instinctively we recognized a deeper need—the need to find through government the instrument of our united purpose to solve for the individual the ever-rising problems of a complex civilization.', 'repeated attempts at their solution without the aid of government had left us baffled and bewildered.', 'for, without that aid, we had been unable to create those moral controls over the services of science which are necessary to make science a useful servant instead of a ruthless master of mankind.', 'to do this we knew that we must find practical controls over blind economic forces and blindly selfish men.', 'we of the republic sensed the truth that democratic government has innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered inevitable, to solve problems once considered unsolvable.', 'we would not admit that we could not find a way to master economic epidemics just as, after centuries of fatalistic suffering, we had found a way to master epidemics of disease.', 'we refused to leave the problems of our common welfare to be solved by the winds of chance and the hurricanes of disaster.', 'in this we americans were discovering no wholly new truth; we were writing a new chapter in our book of self-government.', 'this year marks the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the constitutional convention which made us a nation.', 'at that convention our forefathers found the way out of the chaos which followed the revolutionary war; they created a strong government with powers of united action sufficient then and now to solve problems utterly beyond individual or local solution.', 'a century and a half ago they established the federal government in order to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to the american people.', 'today we invoke those same powers of government to achieve the same objectives.', 'four years of new experience have not belied our historic instinct.', 'they hold out the clear hope that government within communities, government within the separate states, and government of the united states can do the things the times require, without yielding its democracy.', 'our tasks in the last four years did not force democracy to take a holiday.', 'nearly all of us recognize that as intricacies of human relationships increase, so power to govern them also must increase power to stop evil; power to do good.', 'the essential democracy of our nation and the safety of our people depend not upon the absence of power, but upon lodging it with those whom the people can change or continue at stated intervals through an honest and free system of elections.', 'the constitution of 1787 did not make our democracy impotent.', ""in fact, in these last four years, we have made the exercise of all power more democratic; for we have begun to bring private autocratic powers into their proper subordination to the public's government."", 'the legend that they were invincible above and beyond the processes of a democracy has been shattered.', 'they have been challenged and beaten.', 'our progress out of the depression is obvious.', 'but that is not all that you and i mean by the new order of things.', 'our pledge was not merely to do a patchwork job with second-hand materials.', 'by using the new materials of social justice we have undertaken to erect on the old foundations a more enduring structure for the better use of future generations.', 'in that purpose we have been helped by achievements of mind and spirit.', 'old truths have been relearned; untruths have been unlearned.', 'we have always known that heedless self-interest was bad morals; we know now that it is bad economics.', 'out of the collapse of a prosperity whose builders boasted their practicality has come the conviction that in the long run economic morality pays.', 'we are beginning to wipe out the line that divides the practical from the ideal; and in so doing we are fashioning an instrument of unimagined power for the establishment of a morally better world.', 'this new understanding undermines the old admiration of worldly success as such.', 'we are beginning to abandon our tolerance of the abuse of power by those who betray for profit the elementary decencies of life.', 'in this process evil things formerly accepted will not be so easily condoned.', 'hard-headedness will not so easily excuse hardheartedness.', 'we are moving toward an era of good feeling.', 'but we realize that there can be no era of good feeling save among men of good will.', 'for these reasons i am justified in believing that the greatest change we have witnessed has been the change in the moral climate of america.', 'among men of good will, science and democracy together offer an ever-richer life and ever-larger satisfaction to the individual.', 'with this change in our moral climate and our rediscovered ability to improve our economic order, we have set our feet upon the road of enduring

Franklin D. Roosevelt,"March 04, 1933","
      
      President Hoover, Mr. Chief Justice, my friends:

This is a day of national consecration. And I am certain that on this day my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our people impels. This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.

In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values have shrunken to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone.

More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.

Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague of locusts. Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily this is because rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.

True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish.

The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.

Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow men.

Recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, on unselfish performance; without them it cannot live. Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This Nation asks for action, and action now.

Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources.

Hand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land. The task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities. It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms. It can be helped by insistence that the Federal, State, and local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced. It can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, and unequal. It can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character. There are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it. We must act and act quickly.

Finally, in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order: there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments, so that there will be an end to speculation with other people's money; and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency.

These are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon a new Congress, in special session, detailed measures for their fulfillment, and I shall seek the immediate assistance of the several States.

Through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo. Our international trade relations, though vastly important, are in point of time and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy. I favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first. I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment, but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment.

The basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not narrowly nationalistic. It is the insistence, as a first considerations, upon the interdependence of the various elements in and parts of the United States-a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the American spirit of the pioneer. It is the way to recovery. It is the immediate way. It is the strongest assurance that the recovery will endure.

In the field of world policy I would dedicate this Nation to the policy of the good neighbor—the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others—the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors.

If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we have never realized before our interdependence on each other; that we cannot merely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective. We are, I know, ready and willing to submit our lives and property to such discipline, because it makes possible a leadership which aims at a larger good. This I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in time of armed strife.

With this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems.

Action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors. Our Constitution is so simple and practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form. That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has produced. It has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world relations.

It is to be hoped that the normal balance of Executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us. But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure.

I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken Nation in the midst of a stricken world may require. These measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to speedy adoption.

But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis—broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.

For the trust reposed in me I will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time. I can do no less.

We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity; with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values; with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike. We aim at the assurance of a rounded and permanent national life.

We do not distrust the future of essential democracy. The people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action. They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership. They have made me the present instrument of their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it.

In this dedication of a Nation we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He protect each and every one of us. May He guide me in the days to come.

If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we have never realized before our interdependence on each other; that we cannot merely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective. We are, I know, ready and willing to submit our lives and property to such discipline, because it makes possible a leadership which aims at a larger good. This I propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in time of armed strife. With this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems. Action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors. Our Constitution is so simple and practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form. That is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has produced. It has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world relations. It is to be hoped that the normal balance of Executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us. But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure. I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken Nation in the midst of a stricken world may require. These measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to speedy adoption. But in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I shall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis—broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe. For the trust reposed in me I will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time. I can do no less. We face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity; with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values; with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike. We aim at the assurance of a rounded and permanent national life. We do not distrust the future of essential democracy. The people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action. They have asked for discipline and direction under leadership. They have made me the present instrument of their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it. In this dedication of a Nation we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He protect each and every one of us. May He guide me in the days to come.  ","    president hoover, mr. chief justice, my friends: this is a day of national consecration. and i am certain that on this day my fellow americans expect that on my induction into the presidency i will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our people impels. this is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. this great nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. so, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. in every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. i am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days. in such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. they concern, thank god, only material things. values have shrunken to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone. more important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment. yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. we are stricken by no plague of locusts. compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it. plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply. primarily this is because rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated. practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men. true they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money. stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. they know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers. they have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish. the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. we may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. the measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit. happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. the joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits. these dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow men. recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, on unselfish performance; without them it cannot live. restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. this nation asks for action, and action now. our greatest primary task is to put people to work. this is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. it can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources. hand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land. the task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities. it can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms. it can be helped by insistence that the federal, state, and local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced. it can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, and unequal. it can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character. there are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it. we must act and act quickly. finally, in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order: there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments, so that there will be an end to speculation with other people's money; and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency. these are the lines of attack. i shall presently urge upon a new congress, in special session, detailed measures for their fulfillment, and i shall seek the immediate assistance of the several states. through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo. our international trade relations, though vastly important, are in point of time and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy. i favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first. i shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment, but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment. the basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not narrowly nationalistic. it is the insistence, as a first considerations, upon the interdependence of the various elements in and parts of the united states-a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the american spirit of the pioneer. it is the way to recovery. it is the immediate way. it is the strongest assurance that the recovery will endure. in the field of world policy i would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor—the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others—the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors. if i read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we have never realized before our interdependence on each other;

it can be help but it can never be help merely by talk about it we must act and act quickly finally in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguard against a return of the evils of the old order there must be a strict supervision of all bank and credit and investments so that there will be an end to speculation with other people money and there must be provision for an

in point of time and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy i favor as a practical policy the put of first things first i shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment the basic think that guide these specific mean of national recovery be not narrowly nationalistic it be the insistence as a first considerations upon the interdependence of the various elements in and part of the unite states-a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the american spirit of the pioneer it be the way to recovery it be the immediate way it be the strongest assurance that the recovery will endure in the field of world policy i would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor—the neighbor who resolutely respect himself and because he do so respect the right of others—the neighbor who respect his obligations and respect the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbor if i read the temper of our people correctly we now realize as we have never realize before our interdependence on each other that we cannot merely take but we must give as well that if we be to go forward we must move as a train and loyal army will to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline because without such discipline no progress be make no leadership become effective we be i know ready and will to submit our live and property to such discipline because it make possible a leadership which aim at a larger good this i propose to offer

a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require these measure or such other measure as the congress may build out of its experience and wisdom i shall seek within my constitutional authority to bring to speedy adoption but in the event that the congress shall fail to take one of these two course and in the event that the national emergency be still critical i shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me i shall ask the congress for the one remain instrument to meet the crisis—broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency as great as the power that would be give to me if we be in fact invade by a foreign foe for the trust repose in me i will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time i can do no less we face the arduous

this is a day of national consecration.', 'and i am certain that on this day my fellow americans expect that on my induction into the presidency i will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our people impels.', 'this is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly.', 'nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today.', 'this great nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.', 'so, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.', 'in every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory.', 'i am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.', 'in such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties.', 'they concern, thank god, only material things.', 'values have shrunken to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone.', 'more important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return.', 'only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.', 'yet our distress comes from no failure of substance.', 'we are stricken by no plague of locusts.', 'compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for.', 'nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it.', 'plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply.', ""primarily this is because rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated."", 'practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.', 'true they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition.', 'faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money.', 'stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence.', 'they know only the rules of a generation of self-seekers.', 'they have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish.', 'the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization.', 'we may now restore that temple to the ancient truths.', 'the measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.', 'happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort.', 'the joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits.', 'these dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow men.', 'recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing.', 'small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, on unselfish performance; without them it cannot live.', 'restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone.', 'this nation asks for action, and action now.', 'our greatest primary task is to put people to work.', 'this is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously.', 'it can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources.', 'hand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land.', 'the task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities.', 'it can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms.', 'it can be helped by insistence that the federal, state, and local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced.', 'it can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, and unequal.', 'it can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character.', 'there are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it.', 'we must act and act quickly.', ""finally, in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order: there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments, so that there will be an end to speculation with other people's money; and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency."", 'these are the lines of attack.', 'i shall presently urge upon a new congress, in special session, detailed measures for their fulfillment, and i shall seek the immediate assistance of the several states.', 'through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo.', 'our international trade relations, though vastly important, are in point of time and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy.', 'i favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first.', 'i shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment, but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment.', 'the basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not narrowly nationalistic.', 'it is the insistence, as a first considerations, upon the interdependence of the various elements in and parts of the united states-a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the american spirit of the pioneer.', 'it is the way to recovery.', 'it is the immediate way.', 'it is the strongest assurance that the recovery will endure.', 'in the field of world policy i would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor—the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others—the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors.', 'if i read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we have never realized before our interdependence on each other; that we cannot merely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress is made, no leadership becomes effective.', 'we are, i know, ready and willing to submit our lives and property to such discipline, because it makes possible a leadership which aims at a larger good.', 'this i propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in time of armed strife.', 'with this pledge taken, i assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems.', 'action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors.', 'our constitution is so simple and practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form.', 'that is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has produced.', 'it has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world relations.', 'it is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us.', 'but it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure.', 'i am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require.', 'these measures, or such other measures as the congress may build out of its experience and wisdom, i shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to speedy adoption.', 'but in the event that the congress shall fail to take one of these two courses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical, i shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me.', 'i shall ask the congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis—broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.', 'for the trust reposed in me i will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time.', 'i can do no less.', 'we face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity; with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values; with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike.', 'we aim at the assurance of a rounded and permanent national life.', 'we do not distrust the future of essential democracy.', 'the people of the united states have not failed.', 'in their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action.', 'they have asked for discipline and direction under leadership.', 'they have made me the present instrument of their wishes.', 'in the spirit of the gift i take it.', 'in this dedication of a nation we humbly ask the blessing of god.', 'may he protect each and every one of us.', 'may he guide me in the days to come.']","['hoover', 'chief', 'justice', 'friends', 'day', 'national', 'consecration', 'certain', 'day',

Herbert Hoover,"March 04, 1929","My Countrymen: 

This occasion is not alone the administration of the most sacred oath which can be assumed by an American citizen. It is a dedication and consecration under God to the highest office in service of our people. I assume this trust in the humility of knowledge that only through the guidance of Almighty Providence can I hope to discharge its ever-increasing burdens. 

It is in keeping with tradition throughout our history that I should express simply and directly the opinions which I hold concerning some of the matters of present importance. 

OUR PROGRESS 

If we survey the situation of our Nation both at home and abroad, we find many satisfactions; we find some causes for concern. We have emerged from the losses of the Great War and the reconstruction following it within creased virility and strength. From this strength we have contributed to the recovery and progress of the world. What America has done has given renewed hope and courage to all who have faith in government by the people. In the large view, we have reached a higher degree of comfort and security than ever existed before in the history of the world. Through liberation from widespread poverty we have reached a higher degree of individual freedom than ever before. The devotion to and concern for our institutions are deep and sincere. We are steadily building a new race--a new civilization great in its own attainments. The influence and high purposes of our Nation are respected among the peoples of the world. We aspire to distinction in the world, but to a distinction based upon confidence in our sense of justice as well as our accomplishments within our own borders and in our own lives. For wise guidance in this great period of recovery the Nation is deeply indebted to Calvin Coolidge. 

But all this majestic advance should not obscure the constant dangers from which self-government must be safeguarded. The strong man must at all times be alert to the attack of insidious disease. 

THE FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEM OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE 

The most malign of all these dangers today is disregard and disobedience of law. Crime is increasing. Confidence in rigid and speedy justice is decreasing. I am not prepared to believe that this indicates any decay in the moral fiber of the American people. I am not prepared to believe that it indicates an impotence of the Federal Government to enforce its laws. 

It is only in part due to the additional burdens imposed upon our judicial system by the eighteenth amendment. The problem is much wider than that. Many influences had increasingly complicated and weakened our law enforcement organization long before the adoption of the eighteenth amendment. 

To reestablish the vigor and effectiveness of law enforcement we must critically consider the entire Federal machinery of justice, the redistribution of its functions, the simplification of its procedure, the provision of additional special tribunals, the better selection of juries, and the more effective organization of our agencies of investigation and prosecution that justice may be sure and that it may be swift. While the authority of the Federal Government extends to but part of our vast system of national, State, and local justice, yet the standards which the Federal Government establishes have the most profound influence upon the whole structure. 

We are fortunate in the ability and integrity of our Federal judges and attorneys. But the system which these officers are called upon to administer is in many respects ill adapted to present-day conditions. Its intricate and involved rules of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminals. There is a belief abroad that by invoking technicalities, subterfuge, and delay, the ends of justice may be thwarted by those who can pay the cost. 

Reform, reorganization, and strengthening of our whole judicial and enforcement system, both in civil and criminal sides, have been advocated for years by statesmen, judges, and bar associations. First steps toward that end should not longer be delayed. Rigid and expeditious justice is the first safeguard of freedom, the basis of all ordered liberty, the vital force of progress. It must not come to be in our Republic that it can be defeated by the indifference of the citizen, by exploitation of the delays and entanglements of the law, or by combinations of criminals. Justice must not fail because the agencies of enforcement are either delinquent or inefficiently organized. To consider these evils, to find their remedy, is the most sore necessity of our times. 

ENFORCEMENT OF THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT 

Of the undoubted abuses which have grown up under the eighteenth amendment,part are due to the causes I have just mentioned; but part are due to the failure of some States to accept their share of responsibility for concurrent enforcement and to the failure of many State and local officials to accept the obligation under their oath of office zealously to enforce the laws. With the failures from these many causes has come a dangerous expansion in the criminal elements who have found enlarged opportunities in dealing in illegal liquor. 

But a large responsibility rests directly upon our citizens. There would be little traffic in illegal liquor if only criminals patronized it. We must awake to the fact that this patronage from large numbers of law-abiding citizens is supplying the rewards and stimulating crime. 

I have been selected by you to execute and enforce the laws of the country. I propose to do so to the extent of my own abilities, but the measure of success that the Government shall attain will depend upon the moral support which you, as citizens, extend. The duty of citizens to support the laws of the land is coequal with the duty of their Government to enforce the laws which exist. No greater national service can be given by men and women of good will--who, I know, are not unmindful of the responsibilities of citizenship--than that they should, by their example, assist in stamping out crime and outlawry by refusing participation in and condemning all transactions with illegal liquor. Our whole system of self-government will crumble either if officials elect what laws they will enforce or citizen select what laws they will support. The worst evil of disregard for some law is that it destroys respect for all law. For our citizens to patronize the violation of a particular law on the ground that they are opposed to it is destructive of the very basis of all that protection of life, of homes and property which they rightly claim under other laws. If citizens do not like a law, their duty as honest men and women is to discourage its violation; their right is openly to work for its repeal. 

To those of criminal mind there can be no appeal but vigorous enforcement of the law. Fortunately they are but a small percentage of our people. Their activities must be stopped. 

A NATIONAL INVESTIGATION 

I propose to appoint a national commission for a searching investigation of the whole structure of our Federal system of jurisprudence, to include the method of enforcement of the eighteenth amendment and the causes of abuse under it. Its purpose will be to make such recommendations for reorganization of the administration of Federal laws and court procedure as may be found desirable. In the meantime it is essential that a large part of the enforcement activities be transferred from the Treasury Department to the Department of Justice as a beginning of more effective organization. 

THE RELATION OF GOVERNMENT TO BUSINESS 

The election has again confirmed the determination of the American people that regulation of private enterprise and not Government ownership or operation is the course rightly to be pursued in our relation to business. In recent years we have established a differentiation in the whole method of business regulation between the industries which produce and distribute commodities on the one hand and public utilities on the other. In the former, our laws insist upon effective competition; in the latter, because we substantially confer a monopoly by limiting competition, we must regulate their services and rates. The rigid enforcement of the laws applicable to both groups is the very base of equal opportunity and freedom from domination for all our people, and it is just as essential for the stability and prosperity of business itself as for the protection of the public at large. Such regulation should be extended by the Federal Government within the limitations of the Constitution and only when the individual States are without power to protect their citizens through their own authority. On the other hand, we should be fearless when the authority rests only in the Federal Government. 

COOPERATION BY THE GOVERNMENT 

The larger purpose of our economic thought should be to establish more firmly stability and security of business and employment and thereby remove poverty still further from our borders. Our people have in recent years developed a new-found capacity for cooperation among themselves to effect high purposes in public welfare. It is an advance toward the highest conception of self- government. Self-government does not and should not imply the use of political agencies alone. Progress is born of cooperation in the community--not from governmental restraints. The Government should assist and encourage these movements of collective self- help by itself cooperating with them. Business has by cooperation made great progress in the advancement of service, in stability, in regularity of employment and in the correction of its own abuses. Such progress, however, can continue only so long as business manifests its respect for law. 

There is an equally important field of cooperation by the Federal Government with the multitude of agencies, State, municipal and private, in the systematic development of those processes which directly affect public health, recreation,education, and the home. We have need further to perfect the means by which Government can be adapted to human service. 

EDUCATION 

Although education is primarily a responsibility of the States and local communities, and rightly so, yet the Nation as a whole is vitally concerned in its development everywhere to the highest standards and to complete universality. Self-government can succeed only through an instructed electorate. Our objective is not simply to overcome illiteracy. The Nation has marched far beyond that. The more complex the problems of the Nation become, the greater is the need for more and more advanced instruction. Moreover, as our numbers increase and as our life expands with science and invention,we must discover more and more leaders for every walk of life. We can not hope to succeed in directing this increasingly complex civilization unless we can draw all the talent of leadership from the whole people. One civilization after another has been wrecked upon the attempt to secure sufficient leadership from a single group or class. If we would prevent the growth of class distinctions and would constantly refresh our leadership with the ideals of our people, we must draw constantly from the general mass. The full opportunity for every boy and girl to rise through the selective processes of education can alone secure to us this leadership. 

PUBLIC HEALTH 

In public health the discoveries of science have opened a new era. Many sections of our country and many groups of our citizens suffer from diseases the eradication of which are mere matters of administration and moderate expenditure. Public health service should be as fully organized and as universally incorporated into our governmental system as is public education. The returns are a thousand fold in economic benefits, and infinitely more in reduction of suffering and promotion of human happiness. 

WORLD PEACE 

The United States fully accepts the profound truth that our own progress, prosperity, and peace are interlocked with the progress, prosperity, and peace of all humanity. The whole world is at peace. The dangers to a continuation of this peace today are largely the fear and suspicion which still haunt the world. No suspicion or fear can be rightly directed toward our country. 

Those who have a true understanding of America know that we have no desire for territorial expansion, for economic or other domination of other peoples. Such purposes are repugnant to our ideals of human freedom. Our form of government is ill adapted to the responsibilities which inevitably follow permanent limitation of the independence of other peoples. Superficial observers seem to find no destiny for our abounding increase in population,in wealth and power except that of imperialism. They fail to see that theAmerican people are engrossed in the building for themselves of a new economic system, a new social system, a new political system all of which are characterized by aspirations of freedom of opportunity and thereby are the negation of imperialism. They fail to realize that because of our abounding prosperity our youth are pressing more and more into our institutions of learning;that our people are seeking a larger vision through art, literature, science, and travel; that they are moving toward stronger moral and spiritual life--that from these things our sympathies are broadening beyond the bounds of our Nation and race toward their true expression in a real brotherhood of man. They fail to see that the idealism of America will lead it to no narrow or selfish channel, but inspire it to do its full share as a nation toward the advancement of civilization. It will do that not by mere declaration but by taking a practical part in supporting all useful international undertakings. We not only desire peace with the world, but to see peace maintained throughout the world. We wish to advance the reign of justice and reason toward the extinction of force. 

The recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy sets an advanced standard in our conception of the relations of nations. Its acceptance should pave the way to greater limitation of armament,the offer of which we sincerely extend to the world. But its full realization also implies a greater and greater perfection in the instrumentalities for pacific settlement of controversies between nations. In the creation and use of these instrumentalities we should support every sound method of conciliation, arbitration, and judicial settlement. American statesmen were among the first to propose and they have constantly urged upon the world, the establishment of a tribunal for the settlement of controversies of a justiciable character. The Permanent Court of International Justice in its major purpose is thus peculiarly identified with American ideals and with American statesmanship. No more potent instrumentality for this purpose has ever been conceived and no other is practicable of establishment. The reservations placed upon our adherence should not be misinterpreted. The United States seeks by these reservations no special privilege or advantage but only to clarify our relation to advisory opinions and other matters which are subsidiary to the major purpose of the court. The way should, and I believe will, be found by which we may take our proper place in a movement so fundamental to the progress of peace. 

Our people have determined that we should make no political engagements such as membership in the League of Nations, which may commit us in advance as a nation to become involved in the settlements of controversies between other countries. They adhere to the belief that the independence of America from such obligations increases its ability and availability for service in all fields of human progress. 

I have lately returned from a journey among our sister Republics of the Western Hemisphere. I have received unbounded hospitality and courtesy as their expression of friendliness to our country. We are held by particular bonds of sympathy and common interest with them. They are each of them building a racial character and a culture which is an impressive contribution to human progress. We wish only for the maintenance of their independence, the growth of their stability, and their prosperity. While we have had wars in the Western Hemisphere, yet on the whole the record is in encouraging contrast with that of other parts of the world. Fortunately the New World is largely free from the inheritances of fear and distrust which have so troubled the Old World. We should keep it so. 

It is impossible, my countrymen, to speak of peace without profound emotion. In thousands of homes in America, in millions of homes around the world, there are vacant chairs. It would be a shameful confession of our unworthiness if it should develop that we have abandoned the hope for which all these men died. Surely civilization is old enough, surely mankind is mature enough so that we ought in our own lifetime to find a way to permanent peace. Abroad, to west and east, are nations whose sons mingled their blood with the blood of our sons on the battlefields. Most of these nations have contributed to our race, to our culture, our knowledge, and our progress. From one of them we derive our very language and from many of them much of the genius of our institutions. Their desire for peace is as deep and sincere as our own. 

Peace can be contributed to by respect for our ability in defense. Peace can be promoted by the limitation of arms and by the creation of the instrumentalities for peaceful settlement of controversies. But it will become a reality only through self- restraint and active effort in friendliness and helpfulness. I covet for this administration a record of having further contributed to advance the cause of peace. 

PARTY RESPONSIBILITIES 

In our form of democracy the expression of the popular will can be effected only through the instrumentality of political parties. We maintain party government not to promote intolerant partisanship but because opportunity must be given for expression of the popular will, and organization provided for the execution of its mandates and for accountability of government to the people. It follows that the government both in the executive and the legislative branches must carry out in good faith the platforms upon which the party was entrusted with power. But the government is that of the whole people; the party is the instrument through which policies are determined and men chosen to bring them into being. The animosities of elections should have no place in our Government, for government must concern itself alone with the common weal. 

SPECIAL SESSION OF THE CONGRESS 

Action upon some of the proposals upon which the Republican Party was returned to power, particularly further agricultural relief and limited changes in the tariff, cannot in justice to our farmers, our labor, and our manufacturers be postponed. I shall therefore request a special session of Congress for the consideration of these two questions. I shall deal with each of them upon the assembly of the Congress. 

OTHER MANDATES FROM THE ELECTION 

It appears to me that the more important further mandates from the recent election were the maintenance of the integrity of the Constitution; the vigorous enforcement of the laws; the continuance of economy in public expenditure; the continued regulation of business to prevent domination in the community; the denial of ownership or operation of business by theGovernment in competition with its citizens; the avoidance of policies which would involve us in the controversies of foreign nations; the more effective reorganization of the departments of the Federal Government; the expansion of public works; and the promotion of welfare activities affecting education and the home. 

These were the more tangible determinations of the election, but beyond them was the confidence and belief of the people that we would not neglect the support of the embedded ideals and aspirations of America. These ideals and aspirations are the touchstones upon which the day-to-day administration and legislative acts of government must be tested. More than this, the Government must, so far as lies within its proper powers, give leadership to the realization of these ideals and to the fruition of these aspirations. No one can adequately reduce these things of the spirit to phrases or to a catalogue of definitions. We do know what the attainments of these ideals should be: The preservation of self-government and its full foundations in local government; the perfection of justice whether in economic or in social fields; the maintenance of ordered liberty; the denial of domination by any group or class; the building up and preservation of equality of opportunity; the stimulation of initiative and individuality; absolute integrity in public affairs; the choice of officials for fitness to office;the direction of economic progress toward prosperity for the further lessening of poverty; the freedom of public opinion; the sustaining of education and of the advancement of knowledge; the growth of religious spirit and the tolerance of all faiths; the strengthening of the home; the advancement of peace. 

There is no short road to the realization of these aspirations. Ours is a progressive people, but with a determination that progress must be based upon the foundation of experience. Ill- considered remedies for our faults bring only penalties after them. But if we hold the faith of the men in our mighty past who created these ideals, we shall leave them heightened and strengthened for our children. 

CONCLUSION 

This is not the time and place for extended discussion. The questions before our country are problems of progress to higher standards; they are not the problems of degeneration. They demand thought and they serve to quicken the conscience and enlist our sense of responsibility for their settlement. And that responsibility rests upon you, my countrymen, as much as upon those of us who have been selected for office. 

Ours is a land rich in resources; stimulating in its glorious beauty;filled with millions of happy homes; blessed with comfort and opportunity. In no nation are the institutions of progress more advanced. In no nation are the fruits of accomplishment more secure. In no nation is the government more worthy of respect. No country is more loved by its people. I have an abiding faith in their capacity, integrity, and high purpose. I have no fears for the future of our country. It is bright with hope. 

In the presence of my countrymen, mindful of the solemnity of this occasion, knowing what the task means and the responsibility which it involves, I beg your tolerance, your aid, and your cooperation. I ask the help of AlmightyGod in this service to my country to which you have called me.

But the system which these officers are called upon to administer is in many respects ill adapted to present-day conditions. Its intricate and involved rules of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminals. There is a belief abroad that by invoking technicalities, subterfuge, and delay, the ends of justice may be thwarted by those who can pay the cost.  Reform, reorganization, and strengthening of our whole judicial and enforcement system, both in civil and criminal sides, have been advocated for years by statesmen, judges, and bar associations. First steps toward that end should not longer be delayed. Rigid and expeditious justice is the first safeguard of freedom, the basis of all ordered liberty, the vital force of progress. It must not come to be in our Republic that it can be defeated by the indifference of the citizen, by exploitation of the delays and entanglements of the law, or by combinations of criminals. Justice must not fail because the agencies of enforcement are either delinquent or inefficiently organized. To consider these evils, to find their remedy, is the most sore necessity of our times.  ENFORCEMENT OF THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT  Of the undoubted abuses which have grown up under the eighteenth amendment,part are due to the causes I have just mentioned; but part are due to the failure of some States to accept their share of responsibility for concurrent enforcement and to the failure of many State and local officials to accept the obligation under their oath of office zealously to enforce the laws. With the failures from these many causes has come a dangerous expansion in the criminal elements who have found enlarged opportunities in dealing in illegal liquor.  But a large responsibility rests directly upon our citizens. There would be little traffic in illegal liquor if only criminals patronized it. We must awake to the fact that this patronage from large numbers of law-abiding citizens is supplying the rewards and stimulating crime.  I have been selected by you to execute and enforce the laws of the country. I propose to do so to the extent of my own abilities, but the measure of success that the Government shall attain will depend upon the moral support which you, as citizens, extend. The duty of citizens to support the laws of the land is coequal with the duty of their Government to enforce the laws which exist. No greater national service can be given by men and women of good will--who, I know, are not unmindful of the responsibilities of citizenship--than that they should, by their example, assist in stamping out crime and outlawry by refusing participation in and condemning all transactions with illegal liquor. Our whole system of self-government will crumble either if officials elect what laws they will enforce or citizen select what laws they will support. The worst evil of disregard for some law is that it destroys respect for all law. For our citizens to patronize the violation of a particular law on the ground that they are opposed to it is destructive of the very basis of all that protection of life, of homes and property which they rightly claim under other laws. If citizens do not like a law, their duty as honest men and women is to discourage its violation; their right is openly to work for its repeal.  To those of criminal mind there can be no appeal but vigorous enforcement of the law. Fortunately they are but a small percentage of our people. Their activities must be stopped.  A NATIONAL INVESTIGATION  I propose to appoint a national commission for a searching investigation of the whole structure of our Federal system of jurisprudence, to include the method of enforcement of the eighteenth amendment and the causes of abuse under it. Its purpose will be to make such recommendations for reorganization of the administration of Federal laws and court procedure as may be found desirable. In the meantime it is essential that a large part of the enforcement activities be transferred from the Treasury Department to the Department of Justice as a beginning of more effective organization.  THE RELATION OF GOVERNMENT TO BUSINESS  The election has again confirmed the determination of the American people that regulation of private enterprise and not Government ownership or operation is the course rightly to be pursued in our relation to business. In recent years we have established a differentiation in the whole method of business regulation between the industries which produce and distribute commodities on the one hand and public utilities on the other. In the former, our laws insist upon effective competition; in the latter, because we substantially confer a monopoly by limiting competition, we must regulate their services and rates. The rigid enforcement of the laws applicable to both groups is the very base of equal opportunity and freedom from domination for all our people, and it is just as essential for the stability and prosperity of business itself as for the protection of the public at large. Such regulation should be extended by the Federal Government within the limitations of the Constitution and only when the individual States are without power to protect their citizens through their own authority. On the other hand, we should be fearless when the authority rests only in the Federal Government.  COOPERATION BY THE GOVERNMENT  The larger purpose of our economic thought should be to establish more firmly stability and security of business and employment and thereby remove poverty still further from our borders. Our people have in recent years developed a new-found capacity for cooperation among themselves to effect high purposes in public welfare. It is an advance toward the highest conception of self- government. Self-government does not and should not imply the use of political agencies alone. Progress is born of cooperation in the community--not from governmental restraints. The Government should assist and encourage these movements of collective self- help by itself cooperating with them. Business has by cooperation made great progress in the advancement of service, in stability, in regularity of employment and in the correction of its own abuses. Such progress, however, can continue only so long as business manifests its respect for law.  There is an equally important field of cooperation by the Federal Government with the multitude of agencies, State, municipal and private, in the systematic development of those processes which directly affect public health, recreation,education, and the home. We have need further to perfect the means by which Government can be adapted to human service.  EDUCATION  Although education is primarily a responsibility of the States and local communities, and rightly so, yet the Nation as a whole is vitally concerned in its development everywhere to the highest standards and to complete universality. Self-government can succeed only through an instructed electorate. Our objective is not simply to overcome illiteracy. The Nation has marched far beyond that. The more complex the problems of the Nation become, the greater is the need for more and more advanced instruction. Moreover, as our numbers increase and as our life expands with science and invention,we must discover more and more leaders for every walk of life. We can not hope to succeed in directing this increasingly complex civilization unless we can draw all the talent of leadership from the whole people. One civilization after another has been wrecked upon the attempt to secure sufficient leadership from a single group or class. If we would prevent the growth of class distinctions and would constantly refresh our leadership with the ideals of our people, we must draw constantly from the general mass. The full opportunity for every boy and girl to rise through the selective processes of education can alone secure to us this leadership.  PUBLIC HEALTH  In public health the discoveries of science have opened a new era. Many sections of our country and many groups of our citizens suffer from diseases the eradication of which are mere matters of administration and moderate expenditure. Public health service should be as fully organized and as universally incorporated into our governmental system as is public education. The returns are a thousand fold in economic benefits, and infinitely more in reduction of suffering and promotion of human happiness.  WORLD PEACE  The United States fully accepts the profound truth that our own progress, prosperity, and peace are interlocked with the progress, prosperity, and peace of all humanity. The whole world is at peace. The dangers to a continuation of this peace today are largely the fear and suspicion which still haunt the world. No suspicion or fear can be rightly directed toward our country.  Those who have a true understanding of America know that we have no desire for territorial expansion, for economic or other domination of other peoples. Such purposes are repugnant to our ideals of human freedom. Our form of government is ill adapted to the responsibilities which inevitably follow permanent limitation of the independence of other peoples. Superficial observers seem to find no destiny for our abounding increase in population,in wealth and power except that of imperialism. They fail to see that theAmerican people are engrossed in the building for themselves of a new economic system, a new social system, a new political system all of which are characterized by aspirations of freedom of opportunity and thereby are the negation of imperialism. They fail to realize that because of our abounding prosperity our youth are pressing more and more into our institutions of learning;that our people are seeking a larger vision through art, literature, science, and travel; that they are moving toward stronger moral and spiritual life--that from these things our sympathies are broadening beyond the bounds of our Nation and race toward their true expression in a real brotherhood of man. They fail to see that the idealism of America will lead it to no narrow or selfish channel, but inspire it to do its full share as a nation toward the advancement of civilization. It will do that not by mere declaration but by taking a practical part in supporting all useful international undertakings. We not only desire peace with the world, but to see peace maintained throughout the world. We wish to advance the reign of justice and reason toward the extinction of force.  The recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy sets an advanced standard in our conception of the relations of nations. Its acceptance should pave the way to greater limitation of armament,the offer of which we sincerely extend to the world. But its full realization also implies a greater and greater perfection in the instrumentalities for pacific settlement of controversies between nations. In the creation and use of these instrumentalities we should support every sound method of conciliation, arbitration, and judicial settlement. American statesmen were among the first to propose and they have constantly urged upon the world, the establishment of a tribunal for the settlement of controversies of a justiciable character. The Permanent Court of International Justice in its major purpose is thus peculiarly identified with American ideals and with American statesmanship. No more potent instrumentality for this purpose has ever been conceived and no other is practicable of establishment. The reservations placed upon our adherence should not be misinterpreted. The United States seeks by these reservations no special privilege or advantage but only to clarify our relation to advisory opinions and other matters which are subsidiary to the major purpose of the court. The way should, and I believe will, be found by which we may take our proper place in a movement so fundamental to the progress of peace.  Our people have determined that we should make no political engagements such as membership in the League of Nations, which may commit us in advance as a nation to become involved in the settlements of controversies between other countries. They adhere to the belief that the independence of America from such obligations increases its ability and availability for service in all fields of human progress.  I have lately returned from a journey among our sister Republics of the Western Hemisphere. I have received unbounded hospitality and courtesy as their expression of friendliness to our country. We are held by particular bonds of sympathy and common interest with them. They are each of them building a racial character and a culture which is an impressive contribution to human progress. We wish only for the maintenance of their independence, the growth of their stability, and their prosperity. While we have had wars in the Western Hemisphere, yet on the whole the record is in encouraging contrast with that of other parts of the world. Fortunately the New World is largely free from the inheritances of fear and distrust which have so troubled the Old World. We should keep it so.  It is impossible, my countrymen, to speak of peace without profound emotion. In thousands of homes in America, in millions of homes around the world, there are vacant chairs. It would be a shameful confession of our unworthiness if it should develop that we have abandoned the hope for which all these men died. Surely civilization is old enough, surely mankind is mature enough so that we ought in our own lifetime to find a way to permanent peace. Abroad, to west and east, are nations whose sons mingled their blood with the blood of our sons on the battlefields. Most of these nations have contributed to our race, to our culture, our knowledge, and our progress. From one of them we derive our very language and from many of them much of the genius of our institutions. Their desire for peace is as deep and sincere as our own.  Peace can be contributed to by respect for our ability in defense. Peace can be promoted by the limitation of arms and by the creation of the instrumentalities for peaceful settlement of controversies. But it will become a reality only through self- restraint and active effort in friendliness and helpfulness. I covet for this administration a record of having further contributed to advance the cause of peace.  PARTY RESPONSIBILITIES  In our form of democracy the expression of the popular will can be effected only through the instrumentality of political parties. We maintain party government not to promote intolerant partisanship but because opportunity must be given for expression of the popular will, and organization provided for the execution of its mandates and for accountability of government to the people. It follows that the government both in the executive and the legislative branches must carry out in good faith the platforms upon which the party was entrusted with power. But the government is that of the whole people; the party is the instrument through which policies are determined and men chosen to bring them into being. The animosities of elections should have no place in our Government, for government must concern itself alone with the common weal.  SPECIAL SESSION OF THE CONGRESS  Action upon some of the proposals upon which the Republican Party was returned to power, particularly further agricultural relief and limited changes in the tariff, cannot in justice to our farmers, our labor, and our manufacturers be postponed. I shall therefore request a special session of Congress for the consideration of these two questions. I shall deal with each of them upon the assembly of the Congress.  OTHER MANDATES FROM THE ELECTION  It appears to me that the more important further mandates from the recent election were the maintenance of the integrity of the Constitution; the vigorous enforcement of the laws; the continuance of economy in public expenditure; the continued regulation of business to prevent domination in the community; the denial of ownership or operation of business by theGovernment in competition with its citizens; the avoidance of policies which would involve us in the controversies of foreign nations; the more effective reorganization of the departments of the Federal Government; the expansion of public works; and the promotion of welfare activities affecting education and the home.  These were the more tangible determinations of the election, but beyond them was the confidence and belief of the people that we would not neglect the support of the embedded ideals and aspirations of America. These ideals and aspirations are the touchstones upon which the day-to-day administration and legislative acts of government must be tested. More than this, the Government must, so far as lies within its proper powers, give leadership to the realization of these ideals and to the fruition of these aspirations. No one can adequately reduce these things of the spirit to phrases or to a catalogue of definitions. We do know what the attainments of these ideals should be: The preservation of self-government and its full foundations in local government; the perfection of justice whether in economic or in social fields; the maintenance of ordered liberty; the denial of domination by any group or class; the building up and preservation of equality of opportunity; the stimulation of initiative and individuality; absolute integrity in public affairs; the choice of officials for fitness to office;the direction of economic progress toward prosperity for the further lessening of poverty; the freedom of public opinion; the sustaining of education and of the advancement of knowledge; the growth of religious spirit and the tolerance of all faiths; the strengthening of the home; the advancement of peace.  There is no short road to the realization of these aspirations. Ours is a progressive people, but with a determination that progress must be based upon the foundation of experience. Ill- considered remedies for our faults bring only penalties after them. But if we hold the faith of the men in our mighty past who created these ideals, we shall leave them heightened and strengthened for our children.  CONCLUSION  This is not the time and place for extended discussion. The questions before our country are problems of progress to higher standards; they are not the problems of degeneration. They demand thought and they serve to quicken the conscience and enlist our sense of responsibility for their settlement. And that responsibility rests upon you, my countrymen, as much as upon those of us who have been selected for office.  Ours is a land rich in resources; stimulating in its glorious beauty;filled with millions of happy homes; blessed with comfort and opportunity. In no nation are the institutions of progress more advanced. In no nation are the fruits of accomplishment more secure. In no nation is the government more worthy of respect. No country is more loved by its people. I have an abiding faith in their capacity, integrity, and high purpose. I have no fears for the future of our country. It is bright with hope.  In the presence of my countrymen, mindful of the solemnity of this occasion, knowing what the task means and the responsibility which it involves, I beg your tolerance, your aid, and your cooperation. I ask the help of AlmightyGod in this service to my country to which you have called me. ","my countrymen:  this occasion is not alone the administration of the most sacred oath which can be assumed by an american citizen. it is a dedication and consecration under god to the highest office in service of our people. i assume this trust in the humility of knowledge that only through the guidance of almighty providence can i hope to discharge its ever-increasing burdens.  it is in keeping with tradition throughout our history that i should express simply and directly the opinions which i hold concerning some of the matters of present importance.  our progress  if we survey the situation of our nation both at home and abroad, we find many satisfactions; we find some causes for concern. we have emerged from the losses of the great war and the reconstruction following it within creased virility and strength. from this strength we have contributed to the recovery and progress of the world. what america has done has given renewed hope and courage to all who have faith in government by the people. in the large view, we have reached a higher degree of comfort and security than ever existed before in the history of the world. through liberation from widespread poverty we have reached a higher degree of individual freedom than ever before. the devotion to and concern for our institutions are deep and sincere. we are steadily building a new race--a new civilization great in its own attainments. the influence and high purposes of our nation are respected among the peoples of the world. we aspire to distinction in the world, but to a distinction based upon confidence in our sense of justice as well as our accomplishments within our own borders and in our own lives. for wise guidance in this great period of recovery the nation is deeply indebted to calvin coolidge.  but all this majestic advance should not obscure the constant dangers from which self-government must be safeguarded. the strong man must at all times be alert to the attack of insidious disease.  the failure of our system of criminal justice  the most malign of all these dangers today is disregard and disobedience of law. crime is increasing. confidence in rigid and speedy justice is decreasing. i am not prepared to believe that this indicates any decay in the moral fiber of the american people. i am not prepared to believe that it indicates an impotence of the federal government to enforce its laws.  it is only in part due to the additional burdens imposed upon our judicial system by the eighteenth amendment. the problem is much wider than that. many influences had increasingly complicated and weakened our law enforcement organization long before the adoption of the eighteenth amendment.  to reestablish the vigor and effectiveness of law enforcement we must critically consider the entire federal machinery of justice, the redistribution of its functions, the simplification of its procedure, the provision of additional special tribunals, the better selection of juries, and the more effective organization of our agencies of investigation and prosecution that justice may be sure and that it may be swift. while the authority of the federal government extends to but part of our vast system of national, state, and local justice, yet the standards which the federal government establishes have the most profound influence upon the whole structure.  we are fortunate in the ability and integrity of our federal judges and attorneys. but the system which these officers are called upon to administer is in many respects ill adapted to present-day conditions. its intricate and involved rules of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminals. there is a belief abroad that by invoking technicalities, subterfuge, and delay, the ends of justice may be thwarted by those who can pay the cost.  reform, reorganization, and strengthening of our whole judicial and enforcement system, both in civil and criminal sides, have been advocated for years by statesmen, judges, and bar associations. first steps toward that end should not longer be delayed. rigid and expeditious justice is the first safeguard of freedom, the basis of all ordered liberty, the vital force of progress. it must not come to be in our republic that it can be defeated by the indifference of the citizen, by exploitation of the delays and entanglements of the law, or by combinations of criminals. justice must not fail because the agencies of enforcement are either delinquent or inefficiently organized. to consider these evils, to find their remedy, is the most sore necessity of our times.  enforcement of the eighteenth amendment  of the undoubted abuses which have grown up under the eighteenth amendment,part are due to the causes i

no country is more loved by its people. i have an abiding faith in their capacity, integrity, and high purpose. i have no fears for the future of our country. it is bright with hope.  in the presence of my countrymen, mindful of the solemnity of this occasion, knowing what the task means and the responsibility which it involves, i beg your tolerance, your aid, and your cooperation. i ask the help of almightygod in this service to my country to which you have called me. ",my countrymen  this occasion is not alone the administration of the most sacred oath which can be assumed by an american citizen it is a dedication and consecration under god to the highest office in service of our people i assume this trust in the humility of knowledge that only through the guidance of almighty providence can i hope to discharge its ever-increasing burdens  it is in keeping with tradition throughout our history that i should express simply and directly the opinions which i hold concerning some of the matters of present importance  our progress  if we survey the situation of our nation both at home and abroad we find many satisfactions we find some causes for concern we have emerged from the losses of the great war and the reconstruction following it within creased virility and strength from this strength we have contributed to the recovery and progress of the world what america has done has given renewed hope and courage to all who have faith in government by the people in the large view we have reached a higher degree of comfort and security than ever existed before in the history of the world through liberation from widespread poverty we have reached a higher degree of individual freedom than ever before the devotion to and concern for our institutions are deep and sincere we are steadily building a new race--a new civilization great in its own attainments the influence and high purposes of our nation are respected among the peoples of the world we aspire to distinction in the world but to a distinction based upon confidence in our sense of justice as well as our accomplishments within our own borders and in our own lives for wise guidance in this great period of recovery the nation is deeply indebted to calvin coolidge  but all this majestic advance should not obscure the constant dangers from which self-government must be safeguarded the strong man must at all times be alert to the attack of insidious disease  the failure of our system of criminal justice  the most malign of all these dangers today is disregard and disobedience of law crime is increasing confidence in rigid and speedy justice is decreasing i am not prepared to believe that this indicates any decay in the moral fiber of the american people i am not prepared to believe that it indicates an impotence of the federal government to enforce its laws  it is only in part due to the additional burdens imposed upon our judicial system by the eighteenth amendment the problem is much wider than that many influences had increasingly complicated and weakened our law enforcement organization long before the adoption of the eighteenth amendment  to reestablish the vigor and effectiveness of law enforcement we must critically consider the entire federal machinery of justice the redistribution of its functions the simplification of its procedure the provision of additional special tribunals the better selection of juries and the more effective organization of our agencies of investigation and prosecution that justice may be sure and that it may be swift while the authority of the federal government extends to but part of our vast system of national state and local justice yet the standards which the federal government establishes have the most profound influence upon the whole structure  we are fortunate in the ability and integrity of our federal judges and attorneys but the system which these officers are called upon to administer is in many respects ill adapted to present-day conditions its intricate and involved rules of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminals there is a belief abroad that by invoking technicalities subterfuge and delay the ends of justice may be thwarted by those who can pay the cost  reform reorganization and strengthening of our whole judicial and enforcement system both in civil and criminal sides have been advocated for years by statesmen judges and bar associations first steps toward that end should not longer be delayed rigid and expeditious justice is the first safeguard of freedom the basis of all ordered liberty the vital force of progress it must not come to be in our republic that it can be defeated by the indifference of the citizen by exploitation of the delays and entanglements of the law or by combinations of criminals justice must not fail because the agencies of enforcement are either delinquent or inefficiently organized to consider these evils to find their remedy is the most sore necessity of our times  enforcement of the eighteenth amendment  of the undoubted abuses which have grown up under the eighteenth amendmentpart are due to the causes i have just mentioned but part are due to the failure of some states to accept their share of responsibility for concurrent enforcement and to the failure of many state and local officials to accept the obligation under their oath of office zealously to enforce the laws with the failures from these many causes has come a dangerous expansion in the criminal elements who have found enlarged opportunities in dealing in illegal liquor  but a large responsibility rests directly upon our citizens there would be little traffic in illegal liquor if only criminals patronized it we must awake to the fact that this patronage from large numbers of law-abiding citizens is supplying the rewards and stimulating crime  i have been selected by you to execute and enforce the laws of the country i propose to do so to the extent of my own abilities but the measure of success that the government shall attain will depend upon the moral support which you as citizens extend the duty of citizens to support the laws of the land is coequal with the duty of their government to enforce the laws which exist no greater national service can be given by men and women of good will--who i know are not unmindful of the responsibilities of citizenship--than that they should by their example assist in stamping out crime and outlawry by refusing participation in and condemning all transactions with illegal liquor our whole system of self-government will crumble either if officials elect what laws they will enforce or citizen select what laws they will support the worst evil of disregard for some law is that it destroys respect for all law for our citizens to patronize the violation of a particular law on the ground that they are opposed to it is destructive of the very basis of all that protection of life of homes and property which they rightly claim under other laws if citizens do not like a law their duty as honest men and women is to discourage its violation their right is openly to work for its repeal  to those of criminal mind there can be no appeal but vigorous enforcement of the law fortunately they are but a small percentage of our people their activities must be stopped  a national investigation  i propose to appoint a national commission for a searching investigation of the whole structure of our federal system of jurisprudence to include the method of enforcement of the eighteenth amendment and the causes of abuse under it its purpose will be to make such recommendations for reorganization of the administration of federal laws and court procedure as may be found desirable in the meantime it is essential that a large part of the enforcement activities be transferred from the treasury department to the department of justice as a beginning of more effective organization  the relation of government to business  the election has again confirmed the determination of the american people that regulation of private enterprise and not government ownership or operation is the course rightly to be pursued in our relation to business in recent years we have established a differentiation in the whole method of business regulation between the industries which produce and distribute commodities on the one hand and public utilities on the other in the former our laws insist upon effective competition in the latter because we substantially confer a monopoly by limiting competition we must regulate their services and rates the rigid enforcement of the laws applicable to both groups is the very base of equal opportunity and freedom from domination for all our people and it is just as essential for the stability and prosperity of business itself as for the protection of the public at large such regulation should be extended by the federal government within the limitations of the constitution and only when the individual states are without power to protect their citizens through their own authority on the other hand we should be fearless when the authority rests only in the federal government  cooperation by the government  the larger purpose of our economic thought should be to establish more firmly stability and security of business and employment and thereby remove poverty still further from our borders our people have in recent years developed a new-found capacity for cooperation among themselves to effect high purposes in public welfare it is an advance toward the highest conception of self- government self-government does not and should not imply the use of political agencies alone progress is born of cooperation in the community--not from governmental restraints the government should assist and encourage these movements of collective self- help by itself cooperating with them business has by cooperation made great progress in the advancement of service in stability in regularity of employment and in the correction of its own abuses such progress however can continue only so long as business manifests its respect for law  there is an equally important field of cooperation by the federal government with the multitude of agencies state municipal and private in the systematic development of those processes which directly affect public health recreationeducation and the home we have need further to perfect the means by which government can be adapted to human service  education  although education is primarily a responsibility of the states and local communities and rightly so yet the nation as a whole is vitally concerned in its development everywhere to the highest standards and to complete universality self-government can succeed only through an instructed electorate our objective is not simply to overcome illiteracy the nation has marched far beyond that the more complex the problems of the nation become the greater is the need for more and more advanced instruction moreover as our numbers increase and as our life expands with science and inventionwe must discover more and more leaders for every walk of life we can not hope to succeed in directing this increasingly complex civilization unless we can draw all the talent of leadership from the whole people one civilization after another has been wrecked upon the attempt to secure sufficient leadership from a single group or class if we would prevent the growth of class distinctions and would constantly refresh our leadership with the ideals of our people we must draw constantly from the general mass the full opportunity for every boy and girl to rise through the selective processes of education can alone secure to us this leadership  public health  in public health the discoveries of science have opened a new era many sections of our country and many groups of our citizens suffer from diseases the eradication of which are mere matters of administration and moderate expenditure public health service should be as fully organized and as universally incorporated into our governmental system as is public education the returns are a thousand fold in economic benefits and infinitely more in reduction of suffering and promotion of human happiness  world peace  the united states fully accepts the profound truth that our own progress prosperity and peace are interlocked with the progress prosperity and peace of all humanity the whole world is at peace the dangers to a continuation of this peace today are largely the fear and suspicion which still haunt the world no suspicion or fear can be rightly directed toward our country  those who have a true understanding of america know that we have no desire for territorial expansion for economic or other domination of other peoples such purposes are repugnant to our ideals of human freedom our form of government is ill adapted to the responsibilities which inevitably follow permanent limitation of the independence of other peoples superficial observers seem to find no destiny for our abounding increase in populationin wealth and power except that of imperialism they fail to see that theamerican people are engrossed in the building for themselves of a new economic system a new social system a new political system all of which are characterized by aspirations of freedom of opportunity and thereby are the negation of imperialism they fail to realize that because of our abounding prosperity our youth are pressing more and more into our institutions of learningthat our people are seeking a larger vision through art literature science and travel that they are moving toward stronger moral and spiritual life--that from these things our sympathies are broadening beyond the bounds of our nation and race toward their true expression in a real brotherhood of man they fail to see that the idealism of america will lead it to no narrow or selfish channel but inspire it to do its full share as a nation toward the advancement of civilization it will do that not by mere declaration but by taking a practical part in supporting all useful international undertakings we not only desire peace with the world but to see peace maintained throughout the world we wish to advance the reign of justice and reason toward the extinction of force  the recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy sets an advanced standard in our conception of the relations of nations its acceptance should pave the way to greater limitation of armamentthe offer of which we sincerely extend to the world but its full realization also implies a greater and greater perfection in the instrumentalities for pacific settlement of controversies between nations in the creation and use of these instrumentalities we should support every sound method of conciliation arbitration and judicial settlement american statesmen were among the first to propose and they have constantly urged upon the world the establishment of a tribunal for the settlement of controversies of a justiciable character the permanent court of international justice in its major purpose is thus peculiarly identified with american ideals and with american statesmanship no more potent instrumentality for this purpose has ever been conceived and no other is practicable of establishment the reservations placed upon our adherence should not be misinterpreted the united states seeks by these reservations no special privilege or advantage but only to clarify our relation to advisory opinions and other matters which are subsidiary to the major purpose of the court the way should and i believe will be found by which we may take our proper place in a movement so fundamental to the progress of peace  our people have determined that we should make no political engagements such as membership in the league of nations which may commit us in advance as a nation to become involved in the settlements of controversies between other countries they adhere to the belief that the independence of america from such obligations increases its ability and availability for service in all fields of human progress  i have lately returned from a journey among our sister republics of the western hemisphere i have received unbounded hospitality and courtesy as their expression of friendliness to our country we are held by particular bonds of sympathy and common interest with them they are each of them building a racial character and a culture which is an impressive contribution to human progress we wish only for the maintenance of their independence the growth of their stability and their prosperity while we have had wars in the western hemisphere yet on the whole the record is in encouraging contrast with that of other parts of the world fortunately the new world is largely free from the inheritances of fear and distrust which have so troubled the old world we should keep it so  it is impossible my countrymen to speak of peace without profound emotion in thousands of homes in america in millions of homes around the world there are vacant chairs it would be a shameful confession of our unworthiness if it should develop that we have abandoned the hope for which all these men died surely civilization is old enough surely mankind is mature enough so that we ought in our own lifetime to find a way to permanent peace abroad to west and east are nations whose sons mingled their blood with the blood of our sons on the battlefields most of these nations have contributed to our race to our culture our knowledge and our progress from one of them we derive our very language and from many of them much of the genius of our institutions their desire for peace is as deep and sincere as our own  peace can be contributed to by respect for our ability in defense peace can be promoted by the limitation of arms and by the creation of the instrumentalities for peaceful settlement of controversies but it will become a reality only through self- restraint and active effort in friendliness and helpfulness i covet for this administration a record of having further contributed to advance the cause of peace  party responsibilities  in our form of democracy the expression of the popular will can be effected only through the instrumentality of political parties we maintain party government not to promote intolerant partisanship but because opportunity must be given for expression of the popular will and organization provided for the execution of its mandates and for accountability of government to the people it follows that the government both in the executive and the legislative branches must carry out in good faith the platforms upon which the party was entrusted with power but the government is that of the whole people the party is the instrument through which policies are determined and men chosen to bring them into being the animosities of elections should have no place in our government for government must concern itself alone with the common weal  special session of the congress  action upon some of the proposals upon which the republican party was returned to power particularly further agricultural relief and limited changes in the tariff cannot in justice to our farmers our labor and our manufacturers be postponed i shall therefore request a special session of congress for the consideration of these two questions i shall deal with each of them upon the assembly of the congress  other mandates from the election  it appears to me that the more important further mandates from the recent election were the maintenance of the integrity of the constitution the vigorous enforcement of the laws the continuance of economy in public expenditure the continued regulation of business to prevent domination in the community the denial of ownership or operation of business by thegovernment in competition with its citizens the avoidance of policies which would involve us in the controversies of foreign nations the more effective reorganization of the departments of the federal government the expansion of public works and the promotion of welfare activities affecting education and the home  these were the more tangible determinations of the election but beyond them was the confidence and belief of the people that we would not neglect the support of the embedded ideals and aspirations of america these ideals and aspirations are the touchstones upon which the day-to-day administration and legislative acts of government must be tested more than this the government must so far as lies within its proper powers give leadership to the realization of these ideals and to the fruition of these aspirations no one can adequately reduce these things of the spirit to phrases or to a catalogue of definitions we do know what the attainments of these ideals should be the preservation of self-government and its full foundations in local government the perfection of justice whether in economic or in social fields the maintenance of ordered liberty the denial of domination by any group or class the building up and preservation of equality of opportunity the stimulation of initiative and individuality absolute integrity in public affairs the choice of officials for fitness to officethe direction of economic progress toward prosperity for the further lessening of poverty the freedom of public opinion the sustaining of education and of the advancement of knowledge the growth of religious spirit and the tolerance of all faiths the strengthening of the home the advancement of peace  there is no short road to the realization of these aspirations ours is a progressive people but with a determination that progress must be based upon the foundation of experience ill- considered remedies for our faults bring only penalties after them but if we hold the faith of the men in our mighty past who created these ideals we shall leave them heightened and strengthened for our children  conclusion  this is not the time and place for extended discussion the questions before our country are problems of progress to higher standards they are not the problems of degeneration they demand thought and they serve to quicken the conscience and enlist our sense of responsibility for their settlement and that responsibility rests upon you my countrymen as much as upon those of us who have been selected for office  ours is a land rich in resources stimulating in its glorious beautyfilled with millions of happy homes blessed with comfort and opportunity in no nation are the institutions of progress more advanced in no nation are the fruits of accomplishment more secure in no nation is the government

extended discussion the questions before our country are problems of progress to higher standards they are not the problems of degeneration they demand thought and they serve to quicken the conscience and enlist our sense of responsibility for their settlement and that responsibility rests upon you my countrymen as much as upon those of us who have been selected for office  ours is a land rich in resources stimulating in its glorious beautyfilled with millions of happy homes blessed with comfort and opportunity in no nation are the institutions of progress more advanced in no nation are the fruits of accomplishment more secure in no nation is the government more worthy of respect no country is more loved by its people i have an abiding faith in their capacity integrity and high purpose i have no fears for the future of our country it is bright with hope  in the presence of my countrymen mindful of the solemnity of this occasion knowing what the task means and the responsibility which it involves i beg your tolerance your aid and your cooperation i ask the help of almightygod in this service to my country to which you have called me ,my countrymen  this occasion be not alone the administration of the most sacred oath which can be assume by an american citizen it be a dedication and consecration under god to the highest office in service of our people i assume this trust in the humility of knowledge that only through the guidance of almighty providence can i hope to discharge its ever-increasing burden  it be in keep with tradition throughout our history that i should express simply and directly the opinions which i hold concern some of the matter of present importance  our progress  if we survey the situation of our nation both at home and abroad we find many satisfactions we find some cause for concern we have emerge from the losses of the great war and the reconstruction follow it within crease virility and strength from this strength we have contribute to the recovery and progress of the world what america have do have give renew hope and courage to all who have faith in government by the people in the large view we have reach a higher degree of comfort and security than ever exist before in the history of the world through liberation from widespread poverty we have reach a higher degree of individual freedom than ever before the devotion to and concern for our institutions be deep and sincere we be steadily build a new race--a new civilization great in its own attainments the influence and high purpose of our nation be respect among the people of the world we aspire to distinction in the world but to a distinction base upon confidence in our sense of justice as well as our accomplishments within our own border and in our own live for wise guidance in this great period of recovery the nation be deeply indebted to calvin coolidge  but all this majestic advance should not obscure the constant dangers from which self-government must be safeguard the strong man must at all time be alert to the attack of insidious disease  the failure of our system of criminal justice  the most malign of all these dangers today be disregard and disobedience of law crime be increase confidence in rigid and speedy justice be decrease i be not prepare to believe that this indicate any decay in the moral fiber of the american people i be not prepare to believe that it indicate an impotence of the federal government to enforce its laws  it be only in part due to the additional burden impose upon our judicial system by the eighteenth amendment the problem be much wider than that many influence have increasingly complicate and weaken our law enforcement organization long before the adoption of the eighteenth amendment  to reestablish the vigor and effectiveness of law enforcement we must critically consider the entire federal machinery of justice the redistribution of its function the simplification of its procedure the provision of additional special tribunals the better selection of juries and the more effective organization of our agencies of investigation and prosecution that justice may be sure and that it may be swift while the authority of the federal government extend to but part of our vast system of national state and local justice yet the standards which the federal government establish have the most profound influence upon the whole structure  we be fortunate in the ability and integrity of our federal judge and attorneys but the system which these officer be call upon to administer be in many respect ill adapt to present-day condition its intricate and involve rule of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminals there be a belief abroad that by invoke technicalities subterfuge and delay the end of justice may be thwart by those who can pay the cost  reform reorganization and strengthen of our whole judicial and enforcement system both in civil and criminal side have be advocate for years by statesmen judge and bar associations first step toward that end should not longer be delay rigid and expeditious justice be the first safeguard of freedom the basis of all order liberty the vital force of progress it must not come to be in our republic that it can be defeat by the indifference of the citizen by exploitation of the delay and entanglements of the law or by combinations of criminals justice must not fail because the agencies of enforcement be either delinquent or inefficiently organize to consider these evils to find their remedy be the most sore necessity of our time  enforcement of the eighteenth amendment  of the undoubted abuse which have grow up under the eighteenth amendmentpart be due to the cause i have just mention but part be due to the failure of some state to accept their share of responsibility for concurrent enforcement and to the failure of many state and local officials to accept the obligation under their oath of office zealously to enforce the laws with the failures from these many cause have come a dangerous expansion in the criminal elements who have find enlarge opportunities in deal in illegal liquor  but a large responsibility rest directly upon our citizens there would be little traffic in illegal liquor if only criminals patronize it we must awake to the fact that this patronage from large number of law-abiding citizens be supply the reward and stimulate crime  i have be select by you to execute and enforce the laws of the country i propose to do so to the extent of my own abilities but the measure of success that the government shall attain will depend upon the moral support which you as citizens extend the duty of citizens to support the laws of the land be coequal with the duty of their government to enforce the laws which exist no greater national service can be give by men and women of good will--who i know be not unmindful of the responsibilities of citizenship--than that they should by their example assist in stamp out crime and outlawry by refuse participation in and condemn all transactions with illegal liquor our whole system of self-government will crumble either if officials elect what laws they will enforce or citizen select what laws they will support the worst evil of disregard for some law be that it destroy respect for all law for our citizens to patronize the violation of a particular law on the grind that they be oppose to it be destructive of the very basis of all that protection of life of home and property which they rightly claim under other laws if citizens do not like a law their duty as honest men and women be to discourage its violation their right be openly to work for its repeal  to those of criminal mind there can be no appeal but vigorous enforcement of the law fortunately they be but a small percentage of our people their activities must be stop  a national investigation  i propose to appoint a national commission for a search investigation of the whole structure of our federal system of jurisprudence to include the method of enforcement of the eighteenth amendment and the cause of abuse under it its purpose will be to make such recommendations for reorganization of the administration of federal laws and court procedure as may be find desirable in the meantime it be essential that a large part of the enforcement activities be transfer from the treasury department to the department of justice as a begin of more effective organization  the relation of government to business  the election have again confirm the determination of the american people that regulation of private enterprise and not government ownership or operation be the course rightly to be pursue in our relation to business in recent years we have establish a differentiation in the whole method of business regulation between the industries which produce and distribute commodities on the one hand and public utilities on the other in the former our laws insist upon effective competition in the latter because we substantially confer a monopoly by limit competition we must regulate their service and rat the rigid enforcement of the laws applicable to both group be the very base of equal opportunity and freedom from domination for all our people and it be just as essential for the stability and prosperity of business itself as for the protection of the public at large such regulation should be extend by the federal government within the limitations of the constitution and only when the individual state be without power to protect their citizens through their own authority on the other hand we should be fearless when the authority rest only in the federal government  cooperation by the government  the larger purpose of our economic think should be to establish more firmly stability and security of business and employment and thereby remove poverty still further from our border our people have in recent years develop a new-found capacity for cooperation among themselves to effect high purpose in public welfare it be an advance toward the highest conception of self- government self-government do not and should not imply the use of political agencies alone progress be bear of cooperation in the community--not from governmental restraints the government should assist and encourage these movements of collective self- help by itself cooperate with them business have by cooperation make great progress in the advancement of service in stability in regularity of employment and in the correction of its own abuse such progress however can continue only so long as business manifest its respect for law  there be an equally important field of cooperation by the federal government with the multitude of agencies state municipal and private in the systematic development of those process which directly affect public health recreationeducation and the home we have need further to perfect the mean by which government can be adapt to human service  education  although education be primarily a responsibility of the state and local communities and rightly so yet the nation as a whole be vitally concern in its development everywhere to the highest standards and to complete universality self-government can succeed only through an instruct electorate our objective be not simply to overcome illiteracy the nation have march far beyond that the more complex the problems of the nation become the greater be the need for more and more advance instruction moreover as our number increase and as our life expand with science and inventionwe must discover more and more leaders for every walk of life we can not hope to succeed in direct this increasingly complex civilization unless we can draw all the talent of leadership from the whole people one civilization after another have be wreck upon the attempt to secure sufficient leadership from a single group or class if we would prevent the growth of class distinctions and would constantly refresh our leadership with the ideals of our people we must draw constantly from the general mass the full opportunity for every boy and girl to rise through the selective process of education can alone secure to us this leadership  public health  in public health the discoveries of science have open a new era many section of our country and many group of our citizens suffer from diseases the eradication of which be mere matter of administration and moderate expenditure public health service should be as fully organize and as universally incorporate into our governmental system as be public education the return be a thousand fold in economic benefit and infinitely more in reduction of suffer and promotion of human happiness  world peace  the unite state fully accept the profound truth that our own progress prosperity and peace be interlock with the progress prosperity and peace of all humanity the whole world be at peace the dangers to a continuation of this peace today be largely the fear and suspicion which still haunt the world no suspicion or fear can be rightly direct toward our country  those who have a true understand of america know that we have no desire for territorial expansion for economic or other domination of other people such purpose be repugnant to our ideals of human freedom our form of government be ill adapt to the responsibilities which inevitably follow permanent limitation of the independence of other people superficial observers seem to find no destiny for our abound increase in populationin wealth and power except that of imperialism they fail to see that theamerican people be engross in the build for themselves of a new economic system a new social system a new political system all of which be characterize by aspirations of freedom of opportunity and thereby be the negation of imperialism they fail to realize that because of our abound prosperity our youth be press more and more into our institutions of learningthat our people be seek a larger vision through art literature science and travel that they be move toward stronger moral and spiritual life--that from these things our sympathies be broaden beyond the bound of our nation and race toward their true expression in a real brotherhood of man they fail to see that the idealism of america will lead it to no narrow or selfish channel but inspire it to do its full share as a nation toward the advancement of civilization it will do that not by mere declaration but by take a practical part in support all useful international undertake we not only desire peace with the world but to see peace maintain throughout the world we wish to advance the reign of justice and reason toward the extinction of force  the recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy set an advance standard in our conception of the relations of nations its acceptance should pave the way to greater limitation of armamentthe offer of which we sincerely extend to the world but its full realization also imply a greater and greater perfection in the instrumentalities for pacific settlement of controversies between nations in the creation and use of these instrumentalities we should support every sound method of conciliation arbitration and judicial settlement american statesmen be among the first to propose and they have constantly urge upon the world the establishment of a tribunal for the settlement of controversies of a justiciable character the permanent court of international justice in its major purpose be thus peculiarly identify with american ideals and with american statesmanship no more potent instrumentality for this purpose have ever be conceive and no other be practicable of establishment the reservations place upon our adherence should not be misinterpret the unite state seek by these reservations no special privilege or advantage but only to clarify our relation to advisory opinions and other matter which be subsidiary to the major purpose of the court the way should and i believe will be find by which we may take our proper place in a movement so fundamental to the progress of peace  our people have determine that we should make no political engagements such as membership in the league of nations which may commit us in advance as a nation to become involve in the settlements of controversies between other countries they adhere to the belief that the independence of america from such obligations increase its ability and availability for service in all field of human progress  i have lately return from a journey among our sister republics of the western hemisphere i have receive unbounded hospitality and courtesy as their expression of friendliness to our country we be hold by particular bond of sympathy and common interest with them they be each of them build a racial character and a culture which be an impressive contribution to human progress we wish only for the maintenance of their independence the growth of their stability and their prosperity while we have have war in the western hemisphere yet on the whole the record be in encourage contrast with that of other part of the world fortunately the new world be largely free from the inheritances of fear and distrust which have so trouble the old world we should keep it so  it be impossible my countrymen to speak of peace without profound emotion in thousands of home in america in millions of home around the world there be vacant chair it would be a shameful confession of our unworthiness if it should develop that we have abandon the hope for which all these men die surely civilization be old enough surely mankind be mature enough so that we ought in our own lifetime to find a way to permanent peace abroad to west and east be nations whose sons mingle their blood with the blood of our sons on the battlefields most of these nations have contribute to our race to our culture our knowledge and our progress from one of them we derive our very language and from many of them much of the genius of our institutions their desire for peace be as deep and sincere as our own  peace can be contribute to by respect for our ability in defense peace can be promote by the limitation of arm and by the creation of the instrumentalities for peaceful settlement of controversies but it will become a reality only through self- restraint and active effort in friendliness and helpfulness i covet for this administration a record of have further contribute to advance the cause of peace  party responsibilities  in our form of democracy the expression of the popular will can be effect only through the instrumentality of political party we maintain party government not to promote intolerant partisanship but because opportunity must be give for expression of the popular will and organization provide for the execution of its mandate and for accountability of government to the people it follow that the government both in the executive and the legislative branch must carry out in good faith the platforms upon which the party be entrust with power but the government be that of the whole people the party be the instrument through which policies be determine and men choose to bring them into be the animosities of elections should have no place in our government for government must concern itself alone with the common weal  special session of the congress  action upon some of the proposals upon which the republican party be return to power particularly further agricultural relief and limit change in the tariff cannot in justice to our farmers our labor and our manufacturers be postpone i shall therefore request a special session of congress for the consideration of these two question i shall deal with each of them upon the assembly of the congress  other mandate from the election  it appear to me that the more important further mandate from the recent election be the maintenance of the integrity of the constitution the vigorous enforcement of the laws the continuance of economy in public expenditure the continue regulation of business to prevent domination in the community the denial of ownership or operation of business by thegovernment in competition with its citizens the avoidance of policies which would involve us in the controversies of foreign nations the more effective reorganization of the departments of the federal government the expansion of public work and the promotion of welfare activities affect education and the home  these be the more tangible determinations of the election but beyond them be the confidence and belief of the people that we would not neglect the support of the embed ideals and aspirations of america these ideals and aspirations be the touchstones upon which the day-to-day administration and legislative act of government must be test more than this the government must so far as lie within its proper power give leadership to the realization of these ideals and to the fruition of these aspirations no one can adequately reduce these things of the spirit to phrase or to a catalogue of definitions we do know what the attainments of these ideals should be the preservation of self-government and its full foundations in local government the perfection of justice whether in economic or in social field the maintenance of order liberty the denial of domination by any group or class the build up and preservation of equality of opportunity the stimulation of initiative and individuality absolute integrity in public affairs the choice of officials for fitness to officethe direction of economic progress toward prosperity for the further lessen of poverty the freedom of public opinion the sustain of education and of the advancement of knowledge the growth of religious spirit and the tolerance of all faiths the strengthen of the home the advancement of peace  there be no short road to the realization of these aspirations ours be a progressive people but with a determination that progress must be base upon the

is not alone the administration of the most sacred oath which can be assumed by an american citizen.', 'it is a dedication and consecration under god to the highest office in service of our people.', 'i assume this trust in the humility of knowledge that only through the guidance of almighty providence can i hope to discharge its ever-increasing burdens.', 'it is in keeping with tradition throughout our history that i should express simply and directly the opinions which i hold concerning some of the matters of present importance.', 'our progress  if we survey the situation of our nation both at home and abroad, we find many satisfactions; we find some causes for concern.', 'we have emerged from the losses of the great war and the reconstruction following it within creased virility and strength.', 'from this strength we have contributed to the recovery and progress of the world.', 'what america has done has given renewed hope and courage to all who have faith in government by the people.', 'in the large view, we have reached a higher degree of comfort and security than ever existed before in the history of the world.', 'through liberation from widespread poverty we have reached a higher degree of individual freedom than ever before.', 'the devotion to and concern for our institutions are deep and sincere.', 'we are steadily building a new race--a new civilization great in its own attainments.', 'the influence and high purposes of our nation are respected among the peoples of the world.', 'we aspire to distinction in the world, but to a distinction based upon confidence in our sense of justice as well as our accomplishments within our own borders and in our own lives.', 'for wise guidance in this great period of recovery the nation is deeply indebted to calvin coolidge.', 'but all this majestic advance should not obscure the constant dangers from which self-government must be safeguarded.', 'the strong man must at all times be alert to the attack of insidious disease.', 'the failure of our system of criminal justice  the most malign of all these dangers today is disregard and disobedience of law.', 'crime is increasing.', 'confidence in rigid and speedy justice is decreasing.', 'i am not prepared to believe that this indicates any decay in the moral fiber of the american people.', 'i am not prepared to believe that it indicates an impotence of the federal government to enforce its laws.', 'it is only in part due to the additional burdens imposed upon our judicial system by the eighteenth amendment.', 'the problem is much wider than that.', 'many influences had increasingly complicated and weakened our law enforcement organization long before the adoption of the eighteenth amendment.', 'to reestablish the vigor and effectiveness of law enforcement we must critically consider the entire federal machinery of justice, the redistribution of its functions, the simplification of its procedure, the provision of additional special tribunals, the better selection of juries, and the more effective organization of our agencies of investigation and prosecution that justice may be sure and that it may be swift.', 'while the authority of the federal government extends to but part of our vast system of national, state, and local justice, yet the standards which the federal government establishes have the most profound influence upon the whole structure.', 'we are fortunate in the ability and integrity of our federal judges and attorneys.', 'but the system which these officers are called upon to administer is in many respects ill adapted to present-day conditions.', 'its intricate and involved rules of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminals.', 'there is a belief abroad that by invoking technicalities, subterfuge, and delay, the ends of justice may be thwarted by those who can pay the cost.', 'reform, reorganization, and strengthening of our whole judicial and enforcement system, both in civil and criminal sides, have been advocated for years by statesmen, judges, and bar associations.', 'first steps toward that end should not longer be delayed.', 'rigid and expeditious justice is the first safeguard of freedom, the basis of all ordered liberty, the vital force of progress.', 'it must not come to be in our republic that it can be defeated by the indifference of the citizen, by exploitation of the delays and entanglements of the law, or by combinations of criminals.', 'justice must not fail because the agencies of enforcement are either delinquent or inefficiently organized.', 'to consider these evils, to find their remedy, is the most sore necessity of our times.', 'enforcement of the eighteenth amendment  of the undoubted abuses which have grown up under the eighteenth amendment,part are due to the causes i have just mentioned; but part are due to the failure of some states to accept their share of responsibility for concurrent enforcement and to the failure of many state and local officials to accept the obligation under their oath of office zealously to enforce the laws.', 'with the failures from these many causes has come a dangerous expansion in the criminal elements who have found enlarged opportunities in dealing in illegal liquor.', 'but a large responsibility rests directly upon our citizens.', 'there would be little traffic in illegal liquor if only criminals patronized it.', 'we must awake to the fact that this patronage from large numbers of law-abiding citizens is supplying the rewards and stimulating crime.', 'i have been selected by you to execute and enforce the laws of the country.', 'i propose to do so to the extent of my own abilities, but the measure of success that the government shall attain will depend upon the moral support which you, as citizens, extend.', 'the duty of citizens to support the laws of the land is coequal with the duty of their government to enforce the laws which exist.', 'no greater national service can be given by men and women of good will--who, i know, are not unmindful of the responsibilities of citizenship--than that they should, by their example, assist in stamping out crime and outlawry by refusing participation in and condemning all transactions with illegal liquor.', 'our whole system of self-government will crumble either if officials elect what laws they will enforce or citizen select what laws they will support.', 'the worst evil of disregard for some law is that it destroys respect for all law.', 'for our citizens to patronize the violation of a particular law on the ground that they are opposed to it is destructive of the very basis of all that protection of life, of homes and property which they rightly claim under other laws.', 'if citizens do not like a law, their duty as honest men and women is to discourage its violation; their right is openly to work for its repeal.', 'to those of criminal mind there can be no appeal but vigorous enforcement of the law.', 'fortunately they are but a small percentage of our people.', 'their activities must be stopped.', 'a national investigation  i propose to appoint a national commission for a searching investigation of the whole structure of our federal system of jurisprudence, to include the method of enforcement of the eighteenth amendment and the causes of abuse under it.', 'its purpose will be to make such recommendations for reorganization of the administration of federal laws and court procedure as may be found desirable.', 'in the meantime it is essential that a large part of the enforcement activities be transferred from the treasury department to the department of justice as a beginning of more effective organization.', 'the relation of government to business  the election has again confirmed the determination of the american people that regulation of private enterprise and not government ownership or operation is the course rightly to be pursued in our relation to business.', 'in recent years we have established a differentiation in the whole method of business regulation between the industries which produce and distribute commodities on the one hand and public utilities on the other.', 'in the former, our laws insist upon effective competition; in the latter, because we substantially confer a monopoly by limiting competition, we must regulate their services and rates.', 'the rigid enforcement of the laws applicable to both groups is the very base of equal opportunity and freedom from domination for all our people, and it is just as essential for the stability and prosperity of business itself as for the protection of the public at large.', 'such regulation should be extended by the federal government within the limitations of the constitution and only when the individual states are without power to protect their citizens through their own authority.', 'on the other hand, we should be fearless when the authority rests only in the federal government.', 'cooperation by the government  the larger purpose of our economic thought should be to establish more firmly stability and security of business and employment and thereby remove poverty still further from our borders.', 'our people have in recent years developed a new-found capacity for cooperation among themselves to effect high purposes in public welfare.', 'it is an advance toward the highest conception of self- government.', 'self-government does not and should not imply the use of political agencies alone.', 'progress is born of cooperation in the community--not from governmental restraints.', 'the government should assist and encourage these movements of collective self- help by itself cooperating with them.', 'business has by cooperation made great progress in the advancement of service, in stability, in regularity of employment and in the correction of its own abuses.', 'such progress, however, can continue only so long as business manifests its respect for law.', 'there is an equally important field of cooperation by the federal government with the multitude of agencies, state, municipal and private, in the systematic development of those processes which directly affect public health, recreation,education, and the home.', 'we have need further to perfect the means by which government can be adapted to human service.', 'education  although education is primarily a responsibility of the states and local communities, and rightly so, yet the nation as a whole is vitally concerned in its development everywhere to the highest standards and to complete universality.', 'self-government can succeed only through an instructed electorate.', 'our objective is not simply to overcome illiteracy.', 'the nation has marched far beyond that.', 'the more complex the problems of the nation become, the greater is the need for more and more advanced instruction.', 'moreover, as our numbers increase and as our life expands with science and invention,we must discover more and more leaders for every walk of life.', 'we can not hope to succeed in directing this increasingly complex civilization unless we can draw all the talent of leadership from the whole people.', 'one civilization after another has been wrecked upon the attempt to secure sufficient leadership from a single group or class.', 'if we would prevent the growth of class distinctions and would constantly refresh our leadership with the ideals of our people, we must draw constantly from the general mass.', 'the full opportunity for every boy and girl to rise through the selective processes of education can alone secure to us this leadership.', 'public health  in public health the discoveries of science have opened a new era.', 'many sections of our country and many groups of our citizens suffer from diseases the eradication of which are mere matters of administration and moderate expenditure.', 'public health service should be as fully organized and as universally incorporated into our governmental system as is public education.', 'the returns are a thousand fold in economic benefits, and infinitely more in reduction of suffering and promotion of human happiness.', 'world peace  the united states fully accepts the profound truth that our own progress, prosperity, and peace are interlocked with the progress, prosperity, and peace of all humanity.', 'the whole world is at peace.', 'the dangers to a continuation of this peace today are largely the fear and suspicion which still haunt the world.', 'no suspicion or fear can be rightly directed toward our country.', 'those who have a true understanding of america know that we have no desire for territorial expansion, for economic or other domination of other peoples.', 'such purposes are repugnant to our ideals of human freedom.', 'our form of government is ill adapted to the responsibilities which inevitably follow permanent limitation of the independence of other peoples.', 'superficial observers seem to find no destiny for our abounding increase in population,in wealth and power except that of imperialism.', 'they fail to see that theamerican people are engrossed in the building for themselves of a new economic system, a new social system, a new political system all of which are characterized by aspirations of freedom of opportunity and thereby are the negation of imperialism.', 'they fail to realize that because of our abounding prosperity our youth are pressing more and more into our institutions of learning;that our people are seeking a larger vision through art, literature, science, and travel; that they are moving toward stronger moral and spiritual life--that from these things our sympathies are broadening beyond the bounds of our nation and race toward their true expression in a real brotherhood of man.', 'they fail to see that the idealism of america will lead it to no narrow or selfish channel, but inspire it to do its full share as a nation toward the advancement of civilization.', 'it will do that not by mere declaration but by taking a practical part in supporting all useful international undertakings.', 'we not only desire peace with the world, but to see peace maintained throughout the world.', 'we wish to advance the reign of justice and reason toward the extinction of force.', 'the recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy sets an advanced standard in our conception of the relations of nations.', 'its acceptance should pave the way to greater limitation of armament,the offer of which we sincerely extend to the world.', 'but its full realization also implies a greater and greater perfection in the instrumentalities for pacific settlement of controversies between nations.', 'in the creation and use of these instrumentalities we should support every sound method of conciliation, arbitration, and judicial settlement.', 'american statesmen were among the first to propose and they have constantly urged upon the world, the establishment of a tribunal for the settlement of controversies of a justiciable character.', 'the permanent court of international justice in its major purpose is thus peculiarly identified with american ideals and with american statesmanship.', 'no more potent instrumentality for this purpose has ever been conceived and no other is practicable of establishment.', 'the reservations placed upon our adherence should not be misinterpreted.', 'the united states seeks by these reservations no special privilege or advantage but only to clarify our relation to advisory opinions and other matters which are subsidiary to the major purpose of the court.', 'the way should, and i believe will, be found by which we may take our proper place in a movement so fundamental to the progress of peace.', 'our people have determined that we should make no political engagements such as membership in the league of nations, which may commit us in advance as a nation to become involved in the settlements of controversies between other countries.', 'they adhere to the belief that the independence of america from such obligations increases its ability and availability for service in all fields of human progress.', 'i have lately returned from a journey among our sister republics of the western hemisphere.', 'i have received unbounded hospitality and courtesy as their expression of friendliness to our country.', 'we are held by particular bonds of sympathy and common interest with them.', 'they are each of them building a racial character and a culture which is an impressive contribution to human progress.', 'we wish only for the maintenance of their independence, the growth of their stability, and their prosperity.', 'while we have had wars in the western hemisphere, yet on the whole the record is in encouraging contrast with that of other parts of the world.', 'fortunately the new world is largely free from the inheritances of fear and distrust which have so troubled the old world.', 'we should keep it so.', 'it is impossible, my countrymen, to speak of peace without profound emotion.', 'in thousands of homes in america, in millions of homes around the world, there are vacant chairs.', 'it would be a shameful confession of our unworthiness if it should develop that we have abandoned the hope for which all these men died.', 'surely civilization is old enough, surely mankind is mature enough so that we ought in our own lifetime to find a way to permanent peace.', 'abroad, to west and east, are nations whose sons mingled their blood with the blood of our sons on the battlefields.', 'most of these nations have contributed to our race, to our culture, our knowledge, and our progress.', 'from one of them we derive our very language and from many of them much of the genius of our institutions.', 'their desire for peace is as deep and sincere as our own.', 'peace can be contributed to by respect for our ability in defense.', 'peace can be promoted by the limitation of arms and by the creation of the instrumentalities for peaceful settlement of controversies.', 'but it will become a reality only through self- restraint and active effort in friendliness and helpfulness.', 'i covet for this administration a record of having further contributed to advance the cause of peace.', 'party responsibilities  in our form of democracy the expression of the popular will can be effected only through the instrumentality of political parties.', 'we maintain party government not to promote intolerant partisanship but because opportunity must be given for expression of the popular will, and organization provided for the execution of its mandates and for accountability of government to the people.', 'it follows that the government both in the executive and the legislative branches must carry out in good faith the platforms upon which the party was entrusted with power.', 'but the government is that of the whole people; the party is the instrument through which policies are determined and men chosen to bring them into being.', 'the animosities of elections should have no place in our government, for government must concern itself alone with the common weal.', 'special session of the congress  action upon some of the proposals upon which the republican party was returned to power, particularly further agricultural relief and limited changes in the tariff, cannot in justice to our farmers, our labor, and our manufacturers be postponed.', 'i shall therefore request a special session of congress for the consideration of these two questions.', 'i shall deal with each of them upon the assembly of the congress.', 'other mandates from the election  it appears to me that the more important further mandates from the recent election were the maintenance of the integrity of the constitution; the vigorous enforcement of the laws; the continuance of economy in public expenditure; the continued regulation of business to prevent domination in the community; the denial of ownership or operation of business by thegovernment in competition with its citizens; the avoidance of policies which would involve us in the controversies of foreign nations; the more effective reorganization of the departments of the federal government; the expansion of public works; and the promotion of welfare activities affecting education and the home.', 'these were the more tangible determinations of the election, but beyond them was the confidence and belief of the people that we would not neglect the support of the embedded ideals and aspirations of america.', 'these ideals and aspirations are the touchstones upon which the day-to-day administration and legislative acts of government must be tested.', 'more than this, the government must, so far as lies within its proper powers, give leadership to the realization of these ideals and to the fruition of these aspirations.', 'no one can adequately reduce these things of the spirit to phrases or to a catalogue of definitions.', 'we do know what the attainments of these ideals should be: the preservation of self-government and its full foundations in local government; the perfection of justice whether in economic or in social fields; the maintenance of ordered liberty; the denial of domination by any group or class; the building up and preservation of equality of opportunity; the stimulation of initiative and individuality; absolute integrity in public affairs; the choice of officials for fitness to office;the direction of economic progress toward prosperity for the further lessening of poverty; the freedom of public opinion; the sustaining of education and of the advancement of knowledge; the growth of religious spirit and the tolerance of all faiths; the strengthening of the home; the advancement of peace.', 'there is no short road to the realization of these aspirations.', 'ours is a progressive people, but with a determination that progress must be based upon the foundation of experience.', 'ill- considered remedies for our faults bring only penalties after them.', 'but if we hold the faith of the men in our mighty past who created these ideals, we shall leave them heightened and strengthened for our children.', 'conclusion  this is not the time and place for extended discussion.', 'the questions before our country are problems of progress to higher standards; they are not the problems of degeneration.', 'they demand thought and they serve to quicken the conscience and enlist our sense of responsibility for their settlement.', 'and that responsibility rests upon you, my countrymen, as much as upon those of us who have been selected for office.', 'ours is a land rich in resources; stimulating in its glorious beauty;filled with millions of happy homes; blessed with comfort and opportunity.', 'in no nation are the institutions of progress more advanced.', 'in no nation are the fruits of accomplishment more secure.', 'in no nation is the government more worthy of respect.', 'no country is more loved by its people.', 'i have an abiding faith in their capacity, integrity, and high purpose.', 'i have no fears for the future of our country.', 'it is bright with hope.', 'in the presence of my countrymen, mindful of the solemnity of this occasion, knowing what the task means and the responsibility which it involves, i beg your tolerance, your aid, and your cooperation.', 'i ask the help of almightygod in this service to my country to which you have called me.']","['countrymen', 'occasion', 'alone', 'administration', 'sacred', 'oath', 'assume', 'american', 'citizen', 'dedication',

Calvin Coolidge,"March 04, 1925","My Countrymen: No one can contemplate current conditions without finding much thatis satisfying and still more that is encouraging. Our own country is leadingthe world in the general readjustment to the results of the great conflict.Many of its burdens will bear heavily upon us for years, and the secondaryand indirect effects we must expect to experience for some time. But weare beginning to comprehend more definitely what course should be pursued,what remedies ought to be applied, what actions should be taken for ourdeliverance, and are clearly manifesting a determined will faithfully andconscientiously to adopt these methods of relief. Already we have sufficientlyrearranged our domestic affairs so that confidence has returned, businesshas revived, and we appear to be entering an era of prosperity which isgradually reaching into every part of the Nation. Realizing that we cannot live unto ourselves alone, we have contributed of our resources andour counsel to the relief of the suffering and the settlement of the disputesamong the European nations. Because of what America is and what Americahas done, a firmer courage, a higher hope, inspires the heart of all humanity. These results have not occurred by mere chance. They have been securedby a constant and enlightened effort marked by many sacrifices and extendingover many generations. We can not continue these brilliant successes inthe future, unless we continue to learn from the past. It is necessaryto keep the former experiences of our country both at home and abroad continuallybefore us, if we are to have any science of government. If we wish to erectnew structures, we must have a definite knowledge of the old foundations.We must realize that human nature is about the most constant thing in theuniverse and that the essentials of human relationship do not change. Wemust frequently take our bearings from these fixed stars of our politicalfirmament if we expect to hold a true course. If we examine carefully whatwe have done, we can determine the more accurately what we can do. We stand at the opening of the one hundred and fiftieth year since ournational consciousness first asserted itself by unmistakable action withan array of force. The old sentiment of detached and dependent coloniesdisappeared in the new sentiment of a united and independent Nation. Menbegan to discard the narrow confines of a local charter for the broaderopportunities of a national constitution. Under the eternal urge of freedomwe became an independent Nation. A little less than 50 years later thatfreedom and independence were reasserted in the face of all the world,and guarded, supported, and secured by the Monroe doctrine. The narrowfringe of States along the Atlantic seaboard advanced its frontiers acrossthe hills and plains of an intervening continent until it passed down thegolden slope to the Pacific. We made freedom a birthright. We extendedour domain over distant islands in order to safeguard our own interestsand accepted the consequent obligation to bestow justice and liberty uponless favored peoples. In the defense of our own ideals and in the generalcause of liberty we entered the Great War. When victory had been fullysecured, we withdrew to our own shores unrecompensed save in the consciousnessof duty done. Throughout all these experiences we have enlarged our freedom, we havestrengthened our independence. We have been, and propose to be, more andmore American. We believe that we can best serve our own country and mostsuccessfully discharge our obligations to humanity by continuing to beopenly and candidly, in tensely and scrupulously, American. If we haveany heritage, it has been that. If we have any destiny, we have found itin that direction. But if we wish to continue to be distinctively American, we must continueto make that term comprehensive enough to embrace the legitimate desiresof a civilized and enlightened people determined in all their relationsto pursue a conscientious and religious life. We can not permit ourselvesto be narrowed and dwarfed by slogans and phrases. It is not the adjective,but the substantive, which is of real importance. It is not the name ofthe action, but the result of the action, which is the chief concern. Itwill be well not to be too much disturbed by the thought of either isolationor entanglement of pacifists and militarists. The physical configurationof the earth has separated us from all of the Old World, but the commonbrotherhood of man, the highest law of all our being, has united us byinseparable bonds with all humanity. Our country represents nothing butpeaceful intentions toward all the earth, but it ought not to fail to maintainsuch a military force as comports with the dignity and security of a greatpeople. It ought to be a balanced force, intensely modem, capable of defenseby sea and land, beneath the surface and in the air. But it should be soconducted that all the world may see in it, not a menace, but an instrumentof security and peace. This Nation believes thoroughly in an honorable peace under which therights of its citizens are to be everywhere protected. It has never foundthat the necessary enjoyment of such a peace could be maintained only bya great and threatening array of arms. In common with other nations, itis now more determined than ever to promote peace through friendlinessand good will, through mutual understandings and mutual forbearance. Wehave never practiced the policy of competitive armaments. We have recentlycommitted ourselves by covenants with the other great nations to a limitationof our sea power. As one result of this, our Navy ranks larger, in comparison,than it ever did before. Removing the burden of expense and jealousy, whichmust always accrue from a keen rivalry, is one of the most effective methodsof diminishing that unreasonable hysteria and misunderstanding which arethe most potent means of fomenting war. This policy represents a new departurein the world. It is a thought, an ideal, which has led to an entirely newline of action. It will not be easy to maintain. Some never moved fromtheir old positions, some are constantly slipping back to the old waysof thought and the old action of seizing a musket and relying on force.America has taken the lead in this new direction, and that lead Americamust continue to hold. If we expect others to rely on our fairness andjustice we must show that we rely on their fairness and justice. If we are to judge by past experience, there is much to be hoped forin international relations from frequent conferences and consultations.We have before us the beneficial results of the Washington conference andthe various consultations recently held upon European affairs, some ofwhich were in response to our suggestions and in some of which we wereactive participants. Even the failures can not but be accounted usefuland an immeasurable advance over threatened or actual warfare. I am stronglyin favor of continuation of this policy, whenever conditions are such thatthere is even a promise that practical and favorable results might be secured. In conformity with the principle that a display of reason rather thana threat of force should be the determining factor in the intercourse amongnations, we have long advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes bymethods of arbitration and have negotiated many treaties to secure thatresult. The same considerations should lead to our adherence to the PermanentCourt of International Justice. Where great principles are involved, wheregreat movements are under way which promise much for the welfare of humanityby reason of the very fact that many other nations have given such movementstheir actual support, we ought not to withhold our own sanction becauseof any small and inessential difference, but only upon the ground of themost important and compelling fundamental reasons. We can not barter awayour independence or our sovereignty, but we ought to engage in no refinementsof logic, no sophistries, and no subterfuges, to argue away the undoubtedduty of this country by reason of the might of its numbers, the power ofits resources, and its position of leadership in the world, actively andcomprehensively to signify its approval and to bear its full share of theresponsibility of a candid and disinterested attempt at the establishmentof a tribunal for the administration of even-handed justice between nationand nation. The weight of our enormous influence must be cast upon theside of a reign not of force but of law and trial, not by battle but byreason. We have never any wish to interfere in the political conditions of anyother countries. Especially are we determined not to become implicatedin the political controversies of the Old World. With a great deal of hesitation,we have responded to appeals for help to maintain order, protect life andproperty, and establish responsible government in some of the small countriesof the Western Hemisphere. Our private citizens have advanced large sumsof money to assist in the necessary financing and relief of the Old World.We have not failed, nor shall we fail to respond, whenever necessary tomitigate human suffering and assist in the rehabilitation of distressednations. These, too, are requirements which must be met by reason of ourvast powers and the place we hold in the world. Some of the best thought of mankind has long been seeking for a formulafor permanent peace. Undoubtedly the clarification of the principles ofinternational law would be helpful, and the efforts of scholars to preparesuch a work for adoption by the various nations should have our sympathyand support. Much may be hoped for from the earnest studies of those whoadvocate the outlawing of aggressive war. But all these plans and preparations,these treaties and covenants, will not of themselves be adequate. One ofthe greatest dangers to peace lies in the economic pressure to which peoplefind themselves subjected. One of the most practical things to be donein the world is to seek arrangements under which such pressure may be removed,so that opportunity may be renewed and hope may be revived. There mustbe some assurance that effort and endeavor will be followed by successand prosperity. In the making and financing of such adjustments there isnot only an opportunity, but a real duty, for America to respond with hercounsel and her resources. Conditions must be provided under which peoplecan make a living and work out of their difficulties. But there is anotherelement, more important than all, without which there can not be the slightesthope of a permanent peace. That element lies in the heart of humanity.Unless the desire for peace be cherished there, unless this fundamentaland only natural source of brotherly love be cultivated to its highestdegree, all artificial efforts will be in vain. Peace will come when thereis realization that only under a reign of law, based on righteousness andsupported by the religious conviction of the brotherhood of man, can therebe any hope of a complete and satisfying life. Parchment will fail, thesword will fail, it is only the spiritual nature of man that can be triumphant. It seems altogether probable that we can contribute most to these importantobjects by maintaining our position of political detachment and independence.We are not identified with any Old World interests. This position shouldbe made more and more clear in our relations with all foreign countries.We are at peace with all of them. Our program is never to oppress, butalways to assist. But while we do justice to others, we must require thatjustice be done to us. With us a treaty of peace means peace, and a treatyof amity means amity. We have made great contributions to the settlementof contentious differences in both Europe and Asia. But there is a verydefinite point beyond which we can not go. We can only help those who helpthemselves. Mindful of these limitations, the one great duty that standsout requires us to use our enormous powers to trim the balance of the world. While we can look with a great deal of pleasure upon what we have doneabroad, we must remember that our continued success in that direction dependsupon what we do at home. Since its very outset, it has been found necessaryto conduct our Government by means of political parties. That system wouldnot have survived from generation to generation if it had not been fundamentallysound and provided the best instrumentalities for the most complete expressionof the popular will. It is not necessary to claim that it has always workedperfectly. It is enough to know that nothing better has been devised. Noone would deny that there should be full and free expression and an opportunityfor independence of action within the party. There is no salvation in anarrow and bigoted partisanship. But if there is to be responsible partygovernment, the party label must be something more than a mere device forsecuring office. Unless those who are elected under the same party designationare willing to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit sufficientloyalty and coherence, so that they can cooperate with each other in thesupport of the broad general principles, of the party platform, the electionis merely a mockery, no decision is made at the polls, and there is norepresentation of the popular will. Common honesty and good faith withthe people who support a party at the polls require that party, when itenters office, to assume the control of that portion of the Governmentto which it has been elected. Any other course is bad faith and a violationof the party pledges. When the country has bestowed its confidence upon a party by makingit a majority in the Congress, it has a right to expect such unity of actionas will make the party majority an effective instrument of government.This Administration has come into power with a very clear and definitemandate from the people. The expression of the popular will in favor ofmaintaining our constitutional guarantees was overwhelming and decisive.There was a manifestation of such faith in the integrity of the courtsthat we can consider that issue rejected for some time to come. Likewise,the policy of public ownership of railroads and certain electric utilitiesmet with unmistakable defeat. The people declared that they wanted theirrights to have not a political but a judicial determination, and theirindependence and freedom continued and supported by having the ownershipand control of their property, not in the Government, but in their ownhands. As they always do when they have a fair chance, the people demonstratedthat they are sound and are determined to have a sound government. When we turn from what was rejected to inquire what was accepted, thepolicy that stands out with the greatest clearness is that of economy inpublic expenditure with reduction and reform of taxation. The principleinvolved in this effort is that of conservation. The resources of thiscountry are almost beyond computation. No mind can comprehend them. Butthe cost of our combined governments is likewise almost beyond definition.Not only those who are now making their tax returns, but those who meetthe enhanced cost of existence in their monthly bills, know by hard experiencewhat this great burden is and what it does. No matter what others may want,these people want a drastic economy. They are opposed to waste. They knowthat extravagance lengthens the hours and diminishes the rewards of theirlabor. I favor the policy of economy, not because I wish to save money,but because I wish to save people. The men and women of this country whotoil are the ones who bear the cost of the Government. Every dollar thatwe carelessly waste means that their life will be so much the more meager.Every dollar that we prudently save means that their life will be so muchthe more abundant. Economy is idealism in its most practical form. If extravagance were not reflected in taxation, and through taxationboth directly and indirectly injuriously affecting the people, it wouldnot be of so much consequence. The wisest and soundest method of solvingour tax problem is through economy. Fortunately, of all the great nationsthis country is best in a position to adopt that simple remedy. We do notany longer need wartime revenues. The collection of any taxes which arenot absolutely required, which do not beyond reasonable doubt contributeto the public welfare, is only a species of legalized larceny. Under thisrepublic the rewards of industry belong to those who earn them. The onlyconstitutional tax is the tax which ministers to public necessity. Theproperty of the country belongs to the people of the country. Their titleis absolute. They do not support any privileged class; they do not needto maintain great military forces; they ought not to be burdened with agreat array of public employees. They are not required to make any contributionto Government expenditures except that which they voluntarily assess uponthemselves through the action of their own representatives. Whenever taxesbecome burdensome a remedy can be applied by the people; but if they donot act for themselves, no one can be very successful in acting for them. The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction, when, unlesswe wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a living, we must havetax reform. The method of raising revenue ought not to impede the transactionof business; it ought to encourage it. I am opposed to extremely high rates,because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for thecountry, and, finally, because they are wrong. We can not finance the country,we can not improve social conditions, through any system of injustice,even if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich. Those who suffer the mostharm will be the poor. This country believes in prosperity. It is absurdto suppose that it is envious of those who are already prosperous. Thewise and correct course to follow in taxation and all other economic legislationis not to destroy those who have already secured success but to createconditions under which every one will have a better chance to be successful.The verdict of the country has been given on this question. That verdictstands. We shall do well to heed it. These questions involve moral issues. We need not concern ourselvesmuch about the rights of property if we will faithfully observe the rightsof persons. Under our institutions their rights are supreme. It is notproperty but the right to hold property, both great and small, which ourConstitution guarantees. All owners of property are charged with a service.These rights and duties have been revealed, through the conscience of society,to have a divine sanction. The very stability of our society rests uponproduction and conservation. For individuals or for governments to wasteand squander their resources is to deny these rights and disregard theseobligations. The result of economic dissipation to a nation is always moraldecay. These policies of better international understandings, greater economy,and lower taxes have contributed largely to peaceful and prosperous industrialrelations. Under the helpful influences of restrictive immigration anda protective tariff, employment is plentiful, the rate of pay is high,and wage earners are in a state of contentment seldom before seen. Ourtransportation systems have been gradually recovering and have been ableto meet all the requirements of the service. Agriculture has been veryslow in reviving, but the price of cereals at last indicates that the dayof its deliverance is at hand. We are not without our problems, but our most important problem is notto secure new advantages but to maintain those which we already possess.Our system of government made up of three separate and independent departments,our divided sovereignty composed of Nation and State, the matchless wisdomthat is enshrined in our Constitution, all these need constant effort andtireless vigilance for their protection and support. In a republic the first rule for the guidance of the citizen is obedienceto law. Under a despotism the law may be imposed upon the subject. He hasno voice in its making, no influence in its administration, it does notrepresent him. Under a free government the citizen makes his own laws,chooses his own administrators, which do represent him. Those who wanttheir rights respected under the Constitution and the law ought to setthe example themselves of observing the Constitution and the law. Whilethere may be those of high intelligence who violate the law at times, thebarbarian and the defective always violate it. Those who disregard therules of society are not exhibiting a superior intelligence, are not promotingfreedom and independence, are not following the path of civilization, butare displaying the traits of ignorance, of servitude, of savagery, andtreading the way that leads back to the jungle. The essence of a republic is representative government. Our Congressrepresents the people and the States. In all legislative affairs it isthe natural collaborator with the President. In spite of all the criticismwhich often falls to its lot, I do not hesitate to say that there is nomore independent and effective legislative body in the world. It is, andshould be, jealous of its prerogative. I welcome its cooperation, and expectto share with it not only the responsibility, but the credit, for our commoneffort to secure beneficial legislation. These are some of the principles which America represents. We have notby any means put them fully into practice, but we have strongly signifiedour belief in them. The encouraging feature of our country is not thatit has reached its destination, but that it has overwhelmingly expressedits determination to proceed in the right direction. It is true that wecould, with profit, be less sectional and more national in our thought.It would be well if we could replace much that is only a false and ignorantprejudice with a true and enlightened pride of race. But the last electionshowed that appeals to class and nationality had little effect. We wereall found loyal to a common citizenship. The fundamental precept of libertyis toleration. We can not permit any inquisition either within or withoutthe law or apply any religious test to the holding of office. The mindof America must be forever free. It is in such contemplations, my fellow countrymen, which are not exhaustivebut only representative, that I find ample warrant for satisfaction andencouragement. We should not let the much that is to do obscure the muchwhich has been done. The past and present show faith and hope and couragefully justified. Here stands our country, an example of tranquillity athome, a patron of tranquillity abroad. Here stands its Government, awareof its might but obedient to its conscience. Here it will continue to stand,seeking peace and prosperity, solicitous for the welfare of the wage earner,promoting enterprise, developing waterways and natural resources, attentiveto the intuitive counsel of womanhood, encouraging education, desiringthe advancement of religion, supporting the cause of justice and honoramong the nations. America seeks no earthly empire built on blood and force.No ambition, no temptation, lures her to thought of foreign dominions.The legions which she sends forth are armed, not with the sword, but withthe cross. The higher state to which she seeks the allegiance of all mankindis not of human, but of divine origin. She cherishes no purpose save tomerit the favor of Almighty God. ",Inaugural Address,Republican,1,1925,"My Countrymen: No one can contemplate current conditions without finding much thatis satisfying and still more that is encouraging. Our own country is leadingthe world in the general readjustment to the results of the great conflict.Many of its burdens will bear heavily upon us for years, and the secondaryand indirect effects we must expect to experience for some time. But weare beginning to comprehend more definitely what course should be pursued,what remedies ought to be applied, what actions should be taken for ourdeliverance, and are clearly manifesting a determined will faithfully andconscientiously to adopt these methods of relief. Already we have sufficientlyrearranged our domestic affairs so that confidence has returned, businesshas revived, and we appear to be entering an era of prosperity which isgradually reaching into every part of the Nation. Realizing that we cannot live unto ourselves alone, we have contributed of our resources andour counsel to the relief of the suffering and the settlement of the disputesamong the European nations. Because of what America is and what Americahas done, a firmer courage, a higher hope, inspires the heart of all humanity. These results have not occurred by mere chance. They have been securedby a constant and enlightened effort marked by many sacrifices and extendingover many generations. We can not continue these brilliant successes inthe future, unless we continue to learn from the past. It is necessaryto keep the former experiences of our country both at home and abroad continuallybefore us, if we are to have any science of government. If we wish to erectnew structures, we must have a definite knowledge of the old foundations.We must realize that human nature is about the most constant thing in theuniverse and that the essentials of human relationship do not change. Wemust frequently take our bearings from these fixed stars of our politicalfirmament if we expect to hold a true course. If we examine carefully whatwe have done, we can determine the more accurately what we can do. We stand at the opening of the one hundred and fiftieth year since ournational consciousness first asserted itself by unmistakable action withan array of force. The old sentiment of detached and dependent coloniesdisappeared in the new sentiment of a united and independent Nation. Menbegan to discard the narrow confines of a local charter for the broaderopportunities of a national constitution. Under the eternal urge of freedomwe became an independent Nation. A little less than 50 years later thatfreedom and independence were reasserted in the face of all the world,and guarded, supported, and secured by the Monroe doctrine. The narrowfringe of States along the Atlantic seaboard advanced its frontiers acrossthe hills and plains of an intervening continent until it passed down thegolden slope to the Pacific. We made freedom a birthright. We extendedour domain over distant islands in order to safeguard our own interestsand accepted the consequent obligation to bestow justice and liberty uponless favored peoples. In the defense of our own ideals and in the generalcause of liberty we entered the Great War. When victory had been fullysecured, we withdrew to our own shores unrecompensed save in the consciousnessof duty done. Throughout all these experiences we have enlarged our freedom, we havestrengthened our independence. We have been, and propose to be, more andmore American. We believe that we can best serve our own country and mostsuccessfully discharge our obligations to humanity by continuing to beopenly and candidly, in tensely and scrupulously, American. If we haveany heritage, it has been that. If we have any destiny, we have found itin that direction. But if we wish to continue to be distinctively American, we must continueto make that term comprehensive enough to embrace the legitimate desiresof a civilized and enlightened people determined in all their relationsto pursue a conscientious and religious life. We can not permit ourselvesto be narrowed and dwarfed by slogans and phrases. It is not the adjective,but the substantive, which is of real importance. It is not the name ofthe action, but the result of the action, which is the chief concern. Itwill be well not to be too much disturbed by the thought of either isolationor entanglement of pacifists and militarists. The physical configurationof the earth has separated us from all of the Old World, but the commonbrotherhood of man, the highest law of all our being, has united us byinseparable bonds with all humanity.

We are not without our problems, but our most important problem is notto secure new advantages but to maintain those which we already possess.Our system of government made up of three separate and independent departments,our divided sovereignty composed of Nation and State, the matchless wisdomthat is enshrined in our Constitution, all these need constant effort andtireless vigilance for their protection and support. In a republic the first rule for the guidance of the citizen is obedienceto law. Under a despotism the law may be imposed upon the subject. He hasno voice in its making, no influence in its administration, it does notrepresent him. Under a free government the citizen makes his own laws,chooses his own administrators, which do represent him. Those who wanttheir rights respected under the Constitution and the law ought to setthe example themselves of observing the Constitution and the law. Whilethere may be those of high intelligence who violate the law at times, thebarbarian and the defective always violate it. Those who disregard therules of society are not exhibiting a superior intelligence, are not promotingfreedom and independence, are not following the path of civilization, butare displaying the traits of ignorance, of servitude, of savagery, andtreading the way that leads back to the jungle. The essence of a republic is representative government. Our Congressrepresents the people and the States. In all legislative affairs it isthe natural collaborator with the President. In spite of all the criticismwhich often falls to its lot, I do not hesitate to say that there is nomore independent and effective legislative body in the world. It is, andshould be, jealous of its prerogative. I welcome its cooperation, and expectto share with it not only the responsibility, but the credit, for our commoneffort to secure beneficial legislation. These are some of the principles which America represents. We have notby any means put them fully into practice, but we have strongly signifiedour belief in them. The encouraging feature of our country is not thatit has reached its destination, but that it has overwhelmingly expressedits determination to proceed in the right direction. It is true that wecould, with profit, be less sectional and more national in our thought.It would be well if we could replace much that is only a false and ignorantprejudice with a true and enlightened pride of race. But the last electionshowed that appeals to class and nationality had little effect. We wereall found loyal to a common citizenship. The fundamental precept of libertyis toleration. We can not permit any inquisition either within or withoutthe law or apply any religious test to the holding of office. The mindof America must be forever free. It is in such contemplations, my fellow countrymen, which are not exhaustivebut only representative, that I find ample warrant for satisfaction andencouragement. We should not let the much that is to do obscure the muchwhich has been done. The past and present show faith and hope and couragefully justified. Here stands our country, an example of tranquillity athome, a patron of tranquillity abroad. Here stands its Government, awareof its might but obedient to its conscience. Here it will continue to stand,seeking peace and prosperity, solicitous for the welfare of the wage earner,promoting enterprise, developing waterways and natural resources, attentiveto the intuitive counsel of womanhood, encouraging education, desiringthe advancement of religion, supporting the cause of justice and honoramong the nations. America seeks no earthly empire built on blood and force.No ambition, no temptation, lures her to thought of foreign dominions.The legions which she sends forth are armed, not with the sword, but withthe cross. The higher state to which she seeks the allegiance of all mankindis not of human, but of divine origin. She cherishes no purpose save tomerit the favor of Almighty God. ","my countrymen: no one can contemplate current conditions without finding much thatis satisfying and still more that is encouraging. our own country is leadingthe world in the general readjustment to the results of the great conflict.many of its burdens will bear heavily upon us for years, and the secondaryand indirect effects we must expect to experience for some time. but weare beginning to comprehend more definitely what course should be pursued,what remedies ought to be applied, what actions should be taken for ourdeliverance, and are clearly manifesting a determined will faithfully andconscientiously to adopt these methods of relief. already we have sufficientlyrearranged our domestic affairs so that confidence has returned, businesshas revived, and we appear to be entering an era of prosperity which isgradually reaching into every part of the nation. realizing that we cannot live unto ourselves alone, we have contributed of our resources andour counsel to the relief of the suffering and the settlement of the disputesamong the european nations. because of what america is and what americahas done, a firmer courage, a higher hope, inspires the heart of all humanity. these results have not occurred by mere chance. they have been securedby a constant and enlightened effort marked by many sacrifices and extendingover many generations. we can not continue these brilliant successes inthe future, unless we continue to learn from the past. it is necessaryto keep the former experiences of our country both at home and abroad continuallybefore us, if we are to have any science of government. if we wish to erectnew structures, we must have a definite knowledge of the old foundations.we must realize that human nature is about the most constant thing in theuniverse and that the essentials of human relationship do not change. wemust frequently take our bearings from these fixed stars of our politicalfirmament if we expect to hold a true course. if we examine carefully whatwe have done, we can determine the more accurately what we can do. we stand at the opening of the one hundred and fiftieth year since ournational consciousness first asserted itself by unmistakable action withan array of force. the old sentiment of detached and dependent coloniesdisappeared in the new sentiment of a united and independent nation. menbegan to discard the narrow confines of a local charter for the broaderopportunities of a national constitution. under the eternal urge of freedomwe became an independent nation. a little less than 50 years later thatfreedom and independence were reasserted in the face of all the world,and guarded, supported, and secured by the monroe doctrine. the narrowfringe of states along the atlantic seaboard advanced its frontiers acrossthe hills and plains of an intervening continent until it passed down thegolden slope to the pacific. we made freedom a birthright. we extendedour domain over distant islands in order to safeguard our own interestsand accepted the consequent obligation to bestow justice and liberty uponless favored peoples. in the defense of our own ideals and in the generalcause of liberty we entered the great war. when victory had been fullysecured, we withdrew to our own shores unrecompensed save in the consciousnessof duty done. throughout all these experiences we have enlarged our freedom, we havestrengthened our independence. we have been, and propose to be, more andmore american. we believe that we can best serve our own country and mostsuccessfully discharge our obligations to humanity by continuing to beopenly and candidly, in tensely and scrupulously, american. if we haveany heritage, it has been that. if we have any destiny, we have found itin that direction. but if we wish to continue to be distinctively american, we must continueto make that term comprehensive enough to embrace the legitimate desiresof a civilized and enlightened people determined in all their relationsto pursue a conscientious and religious life. we can not permit ourselvesto be narrowed and dwarfed by slogans and phrases. it is not the adjective,but the substantive, which is of real importance. it is not the name ofthe action, but the result of the action, which is the chief concern. itwill be well not to be too much disturbed by the thought of either isolationor entanglement of pacifists and militarists. the physical configurationof the earth has separated us from all of the old world, but the commonbrotherhood of man, the highest law of all our being, has united us byinseparable bonds with all humanity. our country represents nothing butpeaceful intentions toward all the earth, but it ought not to fail to maintainsuch a military force as comports with the dignity and security of a greatpeople. it ought to be a balanced force, intensely modem, capable of defenseby sea and land, beneath the surface and in the air. but it should be soconducted that all the world may see in it, not a menace, but an instrumentof security and peace. this nation believes thoroughly in an honorable peace under which therights of its citizens are to be everywhere protected. it has never foundthat the necessary enjoyment of such a peace could be maintained only bya great and threatening array of arms. in common with other nations, itis now more determined than ever to promote peace through friendlinessand good will, through mutual understandings and mutual forbearance. wehave never practiced the policy of competitive armaments. we have recentlycommitted ourselves by covenants with the other great nations to a limitationof our sea power. as one result of this, our navy ranks larger, in comparison,than it ever did before. removing the burden of expense and jealousy, whichmust always accrue from a keen rivalry, is one of the most effective methodsof diminishing that unreasonable hysteria and misunderstanding which arethe most potent means of fomenting war. this policy represents a new departurein the world. it is a thought, an ideal, which has led to an entirely newline of action. it will not be easy to maintain. some never moved fromtheir old positions, some are constantly slipping back to the old waysof thought and the old action of seizing a musket and relying on force.america has taken the lead in this new direction, and that lead americamust continue to hold. if we expect others to rely on our fairness andjustice we must show that we rely on their fairness and justice. if we are to judge by past experience, there is much to be hoped forin international relations from frequent conferences and consultations.we have before us the beneficial results of the washington conference andthe various consultations recently held upon european affairs, some ofwhich were in response to our suggestions and in some of which we wereactive participants. even the failures can not but be accounted usefuland an immeasurable advance over threatened or actual warfare. i am stronglyin favor of continuation of this policy, whenever conditions are such thatthere is even a promise that practical and favorable results might be secured. in conformity with the principle that a display of reason rather thana threat of force should be the determining factor in the intercourse amongnations, we have long advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes bymethods of arbitration and have negotiated many treaties to secure thatresult. the same considerations should lead to our adherence to the permanentcourt of international justice. where great principles are involved, wheregreat movements are under way which promise much for the welfare of humanityby reason of the very fact that many other nations have given such movementstheir actual support, we ought not to withhold our own sanction becauseof any small and inessential difference, but only upon the ground of themost important and compelling fundamental reasons. we can not barter awayour independence or our sovereignty, but we ought to engage in no refinementsof logic, no sophistries, and no subterfuges, to argue away the undoubtedduty of this country by reason of the might of its numbers, the power ofits resources, and its position of leadership in the world, actively andcomprehensively to signify its approval and to bear its full share of theresponsibility of a candid and disinterested attempt at the establishmentof a tribunal for the administration of even-handed justice between nationand nation. the weight of our enormous influence must be cast upon theside of a reign not of force but of law and trial, not by battle but byreason. we have never any wish to interfere in the political conditions of anyother countries. especially are we determined not to become implicatedin the political controversies of the old world. with a great deal of hesitation,we have responded to appeals for help to maintain order, protect life andproperty, and establish responsible government in some of the small countriesof the western hemisphere. our private citizens have advanced large sumsof money to assist in the necessary financing and relief of the old world.we have not failed, nor shall we fail to respond, whenever necessary tomitigate human suffering and assist in the rehabilitation of distressednations. these, too, are requirements which must be met by reason of ourvast powers and the place we hold in the world. some of the best thought of mankind has long been seeking for a formulafor permanent peace. undoubtedly the clarification of the principles ofinternational law would be helpful, and the efforts of scholars to preparesuch a work for adoption by the various nations should have our sympathyand support. much may be hoped for from the earnest studies of those whoadvocate the outlawing of aggressive war. but all these plans and preparations,these treaties and covenants, will not of themselves be adequate. one ofthe greatest dangers to peace lies in the economic pressure to which peoplefind themselves subjected. one of the most practical things to be donein the world is to seek arrangements under which such pressure may be removed,so that opportunity may be renewed and hope may be revived. there mustbe some assurance that effort and endeavor will be followed by successand prosperity. in the making and financing of such adjustments there isnot only an opportunity, but a real duty, for america to respond with hercounsel and her resources. conditions must be provided under which peoplecan make a living and work out of their difficulties. but there is anotherelement, more important than all, without which there can not be the slightesthope of a permanent peace. that element lies in the heart of humanity.unless the desire for peace be cherished there, unless this fundamentaland only natural source of brotherly love be cultivated to its highestdegree, all artificial efforts will be in vain. peace will come when thereis realization that only under a reign of law, based on righteousness andsupported by the religious conviction of the brotherhood of man, can therebe any hope of a complete and satisfying life. parchment will fail, thesword will fail, it is only the spiritual nature of man that can be triumphant. it seems altogether probable that we can contribute most to these importantobjects by maintaining our position of political detachment and independence.we are not identified with any old world interests. this position shouldbe made more and more clear in our relations with all foreign countries.we are at peace with all of them. our program is never to oppress, butalways to assist. but while we do justice to others, we must require thatjustice be done to us. with us a treaty of peace means peace, and a treatyof amity means amity. we have made great contributions to the settlementof contentious differences in both europe and asia. but there is a verydefinite point beyond which we can not go. we can only help those who helpthemselves. mindful of these limitations, the one great duty that standsout requires us to use our enormous powers to trim the balance of the world. while we can look with a great deal of pleasure upon what we have doneabroad, we must remember that our continued success in that direction dependsupon what we do at home. since its very outset, it has been found necessaryto conduct our government by means of political parties. that system wouldnot have survived from generation to generation if it had not been fundamentallysound and provided the best instrumentalities for the most complete expressionof the popular will. it is not necessary to claim that it has always workedperfectly. it is enough to know that nothing better has been devised. noone would deny that there should be full and free expression and an opportunityfor independence of action within the party. there is no salvation in anarrow and bigoted partisanship. but if there is to be responsible partygovernment, the party label must be something more than a mere device forsecuring office. unless those who are elected under the same party designationare willing to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit sufficientloyalty and coherence, so that they can cooperate with each other in thesupport of the broad general principles, of the party platform, the electionis merely a mockery, no decision is made at the polls, and there is norepresentation of the popular will. common honesty and good faith withthe people who support a party at the polls require that party, when itenters office, to assume the control of that portion of the governmentto which it has been elected. any other course is bad faith and a violationof the party pledges. when the country has bestowed its confidence upon a party by makingit a majority in the congress, it has a right to expect such unity of actionas will make the party majority an effective instrument of government.this administration has come into power with a very clear and definitemandate from the people. the expression of the popular will in favor ofmaintaining our constitutional guarantees was overwhelming and decisive.there was a manifestation of such faith in the integrity of the courtsthat we can consider that issue rejected for some time to come. likewise,the policy of public ownership of railroads and certain electric utilitiesmet with unmistakable defeat. the people declared that they wanted theirrights to have not a political but a judicial determination, and theirindependence and freedom continued and supported by having the ownershipand control of their property, not in the government, but in their ownhands. as they always do when they have a fair chance, the people demonstratedthat they are sound and are determined to have a sound government. when we turn from what was rejected to inquire what was accepted, thepolicy that stands out with the greatest clearness is that of economy inpublic expenditure with reduction and reform of taxation. the principleinvolved in this effort is that of conservation. the resources of thiscountry are almost beyond computation. no mind can comprehend them. butthe cost of our combined governments is likewise almost beyond definition.not only those who are now making their tax returns, but those who meetthe enhanced cost of existence in their monthly bills, know by hard experiencewhat this great burden is and what it does. no matter what others may want,these people want a drastic economy. they are opposed to waste. they knowthat extravagance lengthens the hours and diminishes the rewards of theirlabor. i favor the policy of economy, not because i wish to save money,but because i wish to save people. the men and women of this country whotoil are the ones who bear the cost of the government. every dollar thatwe carelessly waste means that their life will be so much the more meager.every dollar that we prudently save means that their life will be so muchthe more abundant. economy is idealism in its most practical form. if extravagance were not reflected in taxation, and through taxationboth directly and indirectly injuriously affecting the people, it wouldnot be of so much consequence. the wisest and soundest method of solvingour tax problem is through economy. fortunately, of all the great nationsthis country is best in a position to adopt that simple remedy. we do notany longer need wartime revenues. the collection of any taxes which arenot absolutely required, which do not beyond reasonable doubt contributeto the public welfare, is only a species of legalized larceny. under thisrepublic the rewards of industry belong to those who earn them. the onlyconstitutional tax is the tax which ministers to public necessity. theproperty of the country belongs to the people of the country. their titleis absolute. they do not support any privileged class; they do not needto maintain great military forces; they ought not to be burdened with agreat array of public employees. they are not required to make any contributionto government expenditures except that which they voluntarily assess uponthemselves through the action of their own representatives. whenever taxesbecome burdensome a remedy can be applied by the people; but if they donot act for themselves, no one can be very successful in acting for them. the time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction, when, unlesswe wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a living, we must havetax reform. the method of raising revenue ought not to impede the transactionof business; it ought to encourage it. i am opposed to extremely high rates,because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for thecountry, and, finally, because they are wrong. we can not finance the country,we can not improve social conditions, through any system of injustice,even if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich. those who suffer the mostharm will be the poor. this country believes in prosperity. it is absurdto suppose that it is envious of those who are already prosperous. thewise and correct course to follow in taxation and all other economic legislationis not to destroy those who have already secured success but to createconditions under which every one will have a better chance to be successful.the verdict of the country has been given on this question. that verdictstands. we shall do well to heed it. these questions involve moral issues. we need not concern ourselvesmuch about the rights of property if we will faithfully observe the rightsof persons. under our institutions their rights are supreme. it is notproperty but the right to hold property, both great and small, which ourconstitution guarantees. all owners of property are charged with a service.these rights and duties have been revealed, through the conscience of society,to have a divine sanction. the very stability of our society rests uponproduction and conservation. for individuals or for governments to wasteand squander their resources is to deny these rights and disregard theseobligations. the result of economic dissipation to a nation is always moraldecay. these policies of better international understandings, greater economy,and lower taxes have contributed largely to peaceful and prosperous industrialrelations. under the helpful influences of restrictive immigration anda protective tariff, employment is plentiful, the rate of pay is high,and wage earners are in a state of contentment seldom before seen. ourtransportation systems have been gradually recovering and have been ableto meet all the requirements of the service. agriculture has been veryslow in reviving, but the price of cereals at last indicates that the dayof its deliverance is at hand. we are not without our problems, but our most important problem is notto secure new advantages but to maintain those which we already possess.our system of government made up of three separate and independent departments,our divided sovereignty composed of nation and state, the matchless wisdomthat is enshrined in our constitution, all these need constant effort

support a party at the polls require that party when itenters office to assume the control of that portion of the governmentto which it has been elected any other course is bad faith and a violationof the party pledges when the country has bestowed its confidence upon a party by makingit a majority in the congress it has a right to expect such unity of actionas will make the party majority an effective instrument of governmentthis administration has come into power with a very clear and definitemandate from the people the expression of the popular will in favor ofmaintaining our constitutional guarantees was overwhelming and decisivethere was a manifestation of such faith in the integrity of the courtsthat we can consider that issue rejected for some time to come likewisethe policy of public ownership of railroads and certain electric utilitiesmet with unmistakable defeat the people declared that they wanted theirrights to have not a political but a judicial determination and theirindependence and freedom continued and supported by having the ownershipand control of their property not in the government but in their ownhands as they always do when they have a fair chance the people demonstratedthat they are sound and are determined to have a sound government when we turn from what was rejected to inquire what was accepted thepolicy that stands out with the greatest clearness is that of economy inpublic expenditure with reduction and reform of taxation the principleinvolved in this effort is that of conservation the resources of thiscountry are almost beyond computation no mind can comprehend them butthe cost of our combined governments is likewise almost beyond definitionnot only those who are now making their tax returns but those who meetthe enhanced cost of existence in their monthly bills know by hard experiencewhat this great burden is and what it does no matter what others may wantthese people want a drastic economy they are opposed to waste they knowthat extravagance lengthens the hours and diminishes the rewards of theirlabor i favor the policy of economy not because i wish to save moneybut because i wish to save people the men and women of this country whotoil are the ones who bear the cost of the government every dollar thatwe carelessly waste means that their life will be so much the more meagerevery dollar that we prudently save means that their life will be so muchthe more abundant economy is idealism in its most practical form if extravagance were not reflected in taxation and through taxationboth directly and indirectly injuriously affecting the people it wouldnot be of so much consequence the wisest and soundest method of solvingour tax problem is through economy fortunately of all the great nationsthis country is best in a position to adopt that simple remedy we do notany longer need wartime revenues the collection of any taxes which arenot absolutely required which do not beyond reasonable doubt contributeto the public welfare is only a species of legalized larceny under thisrepublic the rewards of industry belong to those who earn them the onlyconstitutional tax is the tax which ministers to public necessity theproperty of the country belongs to the people of the country their titleis absolute they do not support any privileged class they do not needto maintain great military forces they ought not to be burdened with agreat array of public employees they are not required to make any contributionto government expenditures except that which they voluntarily assess uponthemselves through the action of their own representatives whenever taxesbecome burdensome a remedy can be applied by the people but if they donot act for themselves no one can be very successful in acting for them the time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction when unlesswe wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a living we must havetax reform the method of raising revenue ought not to impede the transactionof business it ought to encourage it i am opposed to extremely high ratesbecause they produce little or no revenue because they are bad for thecountry and finally because they are wrong we can not finance the countrywe can not improve social conditions through any system of injusticeeven if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich those who suffer the mostharm will be the poor this country believes in prosperity it is absurdto suppose that it is envious of those who are already prosperous thewise and correct course to follow in taxation and all

accurately what we can do we stand at the opening of the one hundred and fiftieth year since ournational consciousness first asserted itself by unmistakable action withan array of force the old sentiment of detached and dependent coloniesdisappeared in the new sentiment of a united and independent nation menbegan to discard the narrow confines of a local charter for the broaderopportunities of a national constitution under the eternal urge of freedomwe became an independent nation a little less than 50 years later thatfreedom and independence were reasserted in the face of all the

it passed down thegolden slope to the pacific we made freedom a birthright we extendedour domain over distant islands in order to safeguard our own interestsand accepted the consequent obligation to bestow justice and liberty uponless favored peoples in the defense of our own ideals and in the generalcause of liberty we entered the great war when victory had been fullysecured we withdrew to our own shores unrecompensed save in the consciousnessof duty done throughout all these experiences we have enlarged our freedom we havestrengthened our independence we have been and propose to be more andmore american we believe that we can best serve our own country and mostsuccessfully discharge our obligations to humanity by continuing to beopenly and candidly in tensely and scrupulously american if we haveany heritage it has been that if we have any destiny we have found itin that direction but if we wish to continue to be distinctively american we must continueto make that term comprehensive enough to embrace the legitimate desiresof a civilized and enlightened people determined in all their relationsto pursue a conscientious and religious life we can not permit ourselvesto be narrowed and dwarfed by slogans and phrases it is not the adjectivebut the substantive which is of real importance it is not the name ofthe action but the result of the action which is the chief concern itwill be well not to be too much disturbed by the thought of either isolationor entanglement of pacifists and militarists the physical configurationof the earth has separated us from all of the old world but the commonbrotherhood of man the highest law of all our being has united us byinseparable bonds with all humanity our country represents nothing butpeaceful intentions toward all the earth but it ought not to fail to maintainsuch a military force as comports with the dignity and security of a greatpeople it ought to be a balanced force intensely modem capable of defenseby sea and land beneath the surface and in the air but it should be soconducted that all the world may see in it not a menace but an instrumentof security and peace this nation believes thoroughly in an honorable peace under which therights of its citizens are to be everywhere protected it has never foundthat the necessary enjoyment of such a peace could be maintained only bya great and threatening array of arms in common with other nations itis now more determined than ever to promote peace through friendlinessand good will through mutual understandings and mutual forbearance wehave never practiced the policy of competitive armaments we have recentlycommitted ourselves by covenants with the other great nations to a limitationof our sea power as one result of this our navy ranks larger in comparisonthan it ever did before removing the burden of expense and jealousy whichmust always accrue from a keen rivalry is one of the most effective methodsof diminishing that unreasonable hysteria and misunderstanding which arethe most potent means of fomenting war this policy represents a new departurein the world it is a thought an ideal which has led to an entirely newline of action it will not be easy to maintain some never moved fromtheir old positions some are constantly slipping back to the old waysof thought and the old action of seizing a musket and relying on forceamerica has taken the lead in this new direction and that lead americamust continue to hold if we expect others to rely on our fairness andjustice we must show that we rely on their fairness and justice if we are to judge by past experience there is much to be hoped forin international relations from frequent conferences and consultationswe have before us the beneficial results of the washington conference andthe various consultations recently held upon european affairs some ofwhich were in response to our suggestions and in some of which we wereactive participants even the failures can not but be accounted usefuland an immeasurable advance over threatened or actual warfare i am stronglyin favor of continuation of this policy whenever conditions are such thatthere is even a promise that practical and favorable results might be secured in conformity with the principle that a display of reason rather thana threat of force should be the determining factor in the intercourse amongnations we have long advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes bymethods of arbitration and have negotiated many treaties to secure thatresult the same considerations should lead to our adherence to the permanentcourt of international justice where great principles are involved wheregreat movements are under way which promise much for the welfare of humanityby reason of the very fact that many other nations have given such movementstheir actual support we ought not to withhold our own sanction becauseof any small and inessential difference but only upon the ground of themost important and compelling fundamental reasons we can not barter awayour independence or our sovereignty but we ought to engage in no refinementsof logic no sophistries and no subterfuges to argue away the undoubtedduty of this country by reason of the might of its numbers the power ofits resources and its position of leadership in the world actively andcomprehensively to signify its approval and to bear its full share of theresponsibility of a candid and disinterested attempt at the establishmentof a tribunal for the administration of even-handed justice between nationand nation the weight of our enormous influence must be cast upon theside of a reign not of force but of law and trial not by battle but byreason we have never any wish to interfere in the political conditions of anyother countries especially are we determined not to become implicatedin the political controversies of the old world with a great deal of hesitationwe have responded to appeals for help to maintain order protect life andproperty and establish responsible government in some of the small countriesof the western hemisphere our private citizens have advanced large sumsof money to assist in the necessary financing and relief of the old worldwe have not failed nor shall we fail to respond whenever necessary tomitigate human suffering and assist in the rehabilitation of distressednations these too are requirements which must be met by reason of ourvast powers and the place we hold in the world some of the best thought of mankind has long been seeking for a formulafor permanent peace undoubtedly the clarification of the principles ofinternational law would be helpful and the efforts of scholars to preparesuch a work for adoption by the various nations should have our sympathyand support much may be hoped for from the earnest studies of those whoadvocate the outlawing of aggressive war but all these plans and preparationsthese treaties and covenants will not of themselves be adequate one ofthe greatest dangers to peace lies in the economic pressure to which peoplefind themselves subjected one of the most practical things to be donein the world is to seek arrangements under which such pressure may be removedso that opportunity may be renewed and hope may be revived there mustbe some assurance that effort and endeavor will be followed by successand prosperity in the making and financing of such adjustments there isnot only an opportunity but a real duty for america to respond with hercounsel and her resources conditions must be provided under which peoplecan make a living and work out of their difficulties but there is anotherelement more important than all without which there can not be the slightesthope of a permanent peace that element lies in the heart of humanityunless the desire for peace be cherished there unless this fundamentaland only natural source of brotherly love be cultivated to its highestdegree all artificial efforts will be in vain peace will come when thereis realization that only under a reign of law based on righteousness andsupported by the religious conviction of the brotherhood of man can therebe any hope of a complete and satisfying life parchment will fail thesword will fail it is only the spiritual nature of man that can be triumphant it seems altogether probable that we can contribute most to these importantobjects by maintaining our position of political detachment and independencewe are not identified with any old world interests this position shouldbe made more and more clear in our relations with all foreign countrieswe are at peace with all of them our program is never to oppress butalways to assist but while we do justice to others we must require thatjustice be done to us with us a treaty of peace means peace and a treatyof amity means amity we have made great contributions to the settlementof contentious differences in both europe and asia but there is a verydefinite point beyond which we can not go we can only help those who helpthemselves mindful of these limitations the one great duty that standsout requires us to use our enormous powers to trim the balance of the world while we can look with a great deal of pleasure upon what we have doneabroad we must remember that our continued success in that direction dependsupon what we do at home since its very outset it has been found necessaryto conduct our government by means of political parties that system wouldnot have survived from generation to generation if it had not been fundamentallysound and provided the best instrumentalities for the most complete expressionof the popular will it is not necessary to claim that it has always workedperfectly it is enough to know that nothing better has been devised noone would deny that there should be full and free expression and an opportunityfor independence of action within the party there is no salvation in anarrow and bigoted partisanship but if there is to be responsible partygovernment the party label must be something more than a mere device forsecuring office unless those who are elected under the same party designationare willing to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit sufficientloyalty and coherence so that they can cooperate with each other in thesupport of the broad general principles of the party platform the electionis merely a

preparationsthese treaties and covenant will not of themselves be adequate one ofthe greatest dangers to peace lie in the economic pressure to which peoplefind themselves subject one of the most practical things to be donein the world be to seek arrangements under which such pressure may be removedso that opportunity may be renew and hope may be revive there mustbe some assurance that effort and endeavor will be follow by successand prosperity in the make and finance of such adjustments there isnot only an opportunity but a real duty for america to respond with hercounsel and her resources condition must be provide under which peoplecan make a live and work out of their difficulties but there be anotherelement more important than all without which there can not be the slightesthope of a permanent peace that element lie in the heart of humanityunless the desire for peace be cherish there unless this fundamentaland only natural source of brotherly love be cultivate to its highestdegree all artificial efforts will be in vain peace will come when thereis realization that only under a reign of law base on righteousness andsupported by the religious conviction of the brotherhood of man can therebe any hope of a complete and satisfy life parchment will fail thesword will fail it be only the spiritual nature of man that can be triumphant it seem altogether probable that we can contribute most to these importantobjects by maintain our position of political detachment and independencewe be not identify with any old world interest this position shouldbe make more and more clear in our relations with all foreign countrieswe be at peace with all of them our program be never to oppress butalways to assist but while we do justice to others we must require thatjustice be do to us with us a treaty of peace mean peace and a treatyof amity mean amity we have make great contributions to the settlementof contentious differences in both europe and asia but there be a verydefinite point beyond which we can not go we can only help those who helpthemselves mindful of these limitations the one great duty that standsout require us to use our enormous power to trim the balance of the world while we can look with a great deal of pleasure upon what we have doneabroad we must remember that our continue success in that direction dependsupon what we do at home since its very outset it have be find necessaryto conduct our government by mean of political party that system wouldnot have survive from generation to generation if it have not be fundamentallysound and provide the best instrumentalities for the most complete expressionof the popular will it be not necessary to claim that it have always workedperfectly it be enough to know that nothing better have be devise noone would deny that there should be full and free expression and an opportunityfor independence of action within the party there be no salvation in anarrow and bigoted partisanship but if there be to be responsible partygovernment the party label must be something more than a mere device forsecuring office unless those who be elect under the same party designationare will to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit sufficientloyalty and coherence so that they can cooperate with each other in thesupport of the broad general principles of the party platform the electionis merely a mockery no decision be make at the poll and there be norepresentation of the popular will common honesty and good faith withthe people who support a party at the poll require that party when itenters office to assume the control of that portion of the governmentto which it have be elect any other course be bad faith and a violationof the party pledge when the country have bestow its confidence upon a party by makingit a majority in the congress it have a right to expect such unity of actionas will make the party majority an effective instrument of governmentthis administration have come into power with a very clear and definitemandate from the people the expression of the popular will in favor ofmaintaining our constitutional guarantee be overwhelm and decisivethere be a manifestation of such faith in the integrity of the courtsthat we can consider that issue reject for some time to come likewisethe policy of public ownership of railroad and certain electric utilitiesmet with unmistakable defeat the people declare that they want theirrights to have not a political but a judicial determination and theirindependence and freedom continue and support by have the ownershipand control of their property not in the government but in their ownhands as they always do when they have a fair chance the people demonstratedthat they be sound and be determine to have a sound government when we turn from what be reject to inquire what be accept thepolicy that stand out with the greatest clearness be that of economy inpublic expenditure with reduction and reform of taxation the principleinvolved in this effort be that of conservation the resources of thiscountry be almost beyond computation no mind can comprehend them butthe cost of our combine governments be likewise almost beyond definitionnot only those who be now make their tax return but those who meetthe enhance cost of existence in their monthly bill know by hard experiencewhat this great burden be and what it do no matter what others may wantthese people want a drastic economy they be oppose to waste they knowthat extravagance lengthen the hours and diminish the reward of theirlabor i favor the policy of economy not because i wish to save moneybut because i wish to save people the men and women of this country whotoil be the ones who bear the cost of the government every dollar thatwe carelessly waste mean that their life will be so much the more meagerevery dollar that we prudently save mean that their life will be so muchthe more abundant economy be idealism in its most practical form if extravagance be not reflect in taxation and through taxationboth directly and indirectly injuriously affect the people it wouldnot be of so much consequence the wisest and soundest method of solvingour tax problem be through economy fortunately of all the great nationsthis country be best in a position to adopt that simple remedy we do notany longer need wartime revenues the collection of any tax which arenot absolutely require which do not beyond reasonable doubt contributeto the public welfare be only a species of legalize larceny under thisrepublic the reward of industry belong to those who earn them the onlyconstitutional tax be the tax which minister to public necessity theproperty of the country belong to the people of the country their titleis absolute they do not support any privilege class they do not needto maintain great military force they ought not to be burden with agreat array of public employees they be not require to make any contributionto government expenditures except that which they voluntarily assess uponthemselves through the action of their own representatives whenever taxesbecome burdensome a remedy can be apply by the people but if they donot act for themselves no one can be very successful in act for them the time be arrive when we can have further tax reduction when unlesswe wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a live we must havetax reform the method of raise revenue ought not to impede the transactionof business it ought to encourage it i be oppose to extremely high ratesbecause they produce little or no revenue because they be bad for thecountry and finally because they be wrong we can not finance the countrywe can not improve social condition through any system of injusticeeven if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich those who suffer the mostharm will be the poor this country believe in prosperity it be absurdto suppose that it be envious of those who be already prosperous thewise and correct course to follow in taxation and all other economic legislationis not to destroy those who have already secure success but to createconditions under which every one will have a better chance to be successfulthe verdict of the country have be give on this question that verdictstands we shall do well to heed it these question involve moral issue we need not concern ourselvesmuch about the right of property if we will faithfully observe the rightsof persons under our institutions their right be supreme it be notproperty but the right to hold property both great and small which ourconstitution guarantee all owners of property be charge with a servicethese right and duties have be reveal through the conscience of societyto have a divine sanction the very stability of our society rest uponproduction and conservation for individuals or for governments to wasteand squander their resources be to deny these right and disregard theseobligations the result of economic dissipation to a nation be always moraldecay these policies of better international understand greater economyand lower tax have contribute largely to peaceful and prosperous industrialrelations under the helpful influence of restrictive immigration anda protective tariff employment be plentiful the rate of pay be highand wage earners be in a state of contentment seldom

arriving when we can have further tax reduction, when, unlesswe wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a living, we must havetax reform.', 'the method of raising revenue ought not to impede the transactionof business; it ought to encourage it.', 'i am opposed to extremely high rates,because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for thecountry, and, finally, because they are wrong.', 'we can not finance the country,we can not improve social conditions, through any system of injustice,even if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich.', 'those who suffer the mostharm will

Warren G. Harding,"March 04, 1921","My Countrymen: 

When one surveys the world about him after the great storm, noting the marks of destruction and yet rejoicing in the ruggedness of the things which withstood it, if he is an American he breathes the clarified atmosphere with a strange mingling of regret and new hope. We have seen a world passion spend its fury, but we contemplate our Republic unshaken, and hold our civilization secure. Liberty--liberty within the law--and civilization are inseparable, and though both were threatened we find them now secure;and there comes to Americans the profound assurance that our representative government is the highest expression and surest guaranty of both. 

Standing in this presence, mindful of the solemnity of this occasion,feeling the emotions which no one may know until he senses the great weight of responsibility for himself, I must utter my belief in the divine inspiration of the founding fathers. Surely there must have been God's intent in the making of this new-world Republic. Ours is an organic law which had but one ambiguity, and we saw that effaced in a baptism of sacrifice and blood,with union maintained, the Nation supreme, and its concord inspiring. We have seen the world rivet its hopeful gaze on the great truths on which the founders wrought. We have seen civil, human, and religious liberty verified and glorified. In the beginning the Old World scoffed at our experiment;today our foundations of political and social belief stand unshaken, a precious inheritance to ourselves, an inspiring example of freedom and civilization to all mankind. Let us express renewed and strengthened devotion,in grateful reverence for the immortal beginning, and utter our confidence in the supreme fulfillment. 

The recorded progress of our Republic, materially and spiritually, in itself proves the wisdom of the inherited policy of noninvolvement in OldWorld affairs. Confident of our ability to work out our own destiny, and jealously guarding our right to do so, we seek no part in directing the destinies of the Old World. We do not mean to be entangled. We will accept no responsibility except as our own conscience and judgment, in each instance,may determine. 

Our eyes never will be blind to a developing menace, our ears never deaf to the call of civilization. We recognize the new order in the world,with the closer contacts which progress has wrought. We sense the call of the human heart for fellowship, fraternity, and cooperation. We crave friendship and harbor no hate. But America, our America, the America builded on the foundation laid by the inspired fathers, can be a party to no permanent military alliance. It can enter into no political commitments, nor assume any economic obligations which will subject our decisions to any other than our own authority. 

I am sure our own people will not misunderstand, nor will the world misconstrue. We have no thought to impede the paths to closer relationship.We wish to promote understanding. We want to do our part in making offensive warfare so hateful that Governments and peoples who resort to it must prove the righteousness of their cause or stand as outlaws before the bar of civilization. 

We are ready to associate ourselves with the nations of the world, great and small, for conference, for counsel; to seek the expressed views of world opinion; to recommend a way to approximate disarmament and relieve the crushing burdens of military and naval establishments. We elect to participate in suggesting plans for mediation, conciliation, and arbitration,and would gladly join in that expressed conscience of progress, which seeks to clarify and write the laws of international relationship, and establish a world court for the disposition of such justiciable questions as nations are agreed to submit thereto. In expressing aspirations, in seeking practical plans, in translating humanity's new concept of righteousness and justice and its hatred of war into recommended action we are ready most heartily to unite, but every commitment must be made in the exercise of our national sovereignty. Since freedom impelled, and independence inspired, and nationality exalted, a world super government is contrary to everything we cherish and can have no sanction by our Republic. This is not selfishness, it is sanctity.It is not aloofness, it is security. It is not suspicion of others, it is patriotic adherence to the things which made us what we are. 

Today, better than ever before, we know the aspirations of humankind,and share them. We have come to a new realization of our place in the world and a new appraisal of our Nation by the world. The unselfishness of theseUnited States is a thing proven; our devotion to peace for ourselves and for the world is well established; our concern for preserved civilization has had its impassioned and heroic expression. There was no American failure to resist the attempted reversion of civilization; there will be no failure today or tomorrow. 

The success of our popular government rests wholly upon the correct interpretation of the deliberate, intelligent, dependable popular will of America. In a deliberate questioning of a suggested change of national policy, where internationality was to supersede nationality, we turned to a referendum, to the American people. There was ample discussion, and there is a public mandate in manifest understanding. 

America is ready to encourage, eager to initiate, anxious to participate in any seemly program likely to lessen the probability of war, and promote that brotherhood of mankind which must be God's highest conception of human relationship. Because we cherish ideals of justice and peace, because we appraise international comity and helpful relationship no less highly than any people of the world, we aspire to a high place in the moral leadership of civilization, and we hold a maintained America, the proven Republic,the unshaken temple of representative democracy, to be not only an inspiration and example, but the highest agency of strengthening good will and promoting accord on both continents. 

Mankind needs a world-wide benediction of understanding. It is needed among individuals, among peoples, among governments, and it will inaugurate an era of good feeling to make the birth of a new order. In such understanding men will strive confidently for the promotion of their better relationships and nations will promote the comities so essential to peace. 

We must understand that ties of trade bind nations in closest intimacy,and none may receive except as he gives. We have not strengthened ours in accordance with our resources or our genius, notably on our own continent,where a galaxy of Republics reflects the glory of new-world democracy,but in the new order of finance and trade we mean to promote enlarged activities and seek expanded confidence. 

Perhaps we can make no more helpful contribution by example than prove a Republic's capacity to emerge from the wreckage of war. While the world's embittered travail did not leave us devastated lands nor desolated cities,left no gaping wounds, no breast with hate, it did involve us in the delirium of expenditure, in expanded currency and credits, in unbalanced industry,in unspeakable waste, and disturbed relationships. While it uncovered our portion of hateful selfishness at home, it also revealed the heart of America as sound and fearless, and beating in confidence unfailing. 

Amid it all we have riveted the gaze of all civilization to the unselfishness and the righteousness of representative democracy, where our freedom never has made offensive warfare, never has sought territorial aggrandizement through force, never has turned to the arbitrament of arms until reason has been exhausted. When the Governments of the earth shall have established a freedom like our own and shall have sanctioned the pursuit of peace as we have practiced it, I believe the last sorrow and the final sacrifice of international warfare will have been written. 

Let me speak to the maimed and wounded soldiers who are present today,and through them convey to their comrades the gratitude of the Republic for their sacrifices in its defense. A generous country will never forget the services you rendered, and you may hope for a policy under Government that will relieve any maimed successors from taking your places on another such occasion as this. 

Our supreme task is the resumption of our onward, normal way. Reconstruction,readjustment, restoration all these must follow. I would like to hasten them. If it will lighten the spirit and add to the resolution with which we take up the task, let me repeat for our Nation, we shall give no people just cause to make war upon us; we hold no national prejudices; we entertain no spirit of revenge; we do not hate; we do not covet; we dream of no conquest,nor boast of armed prowess. 

If, despite this attitude, war is again forced upon us, I earnestly hope a way may be found which will unify our individual and collective strength and consecrate all America, materially and spiritually, body and soul, to national defense. I can vision the ideal republic, where everyman and woman is called under the flag for assignment to duty for whatever service, military or civic, the individual is best fitted; where we may call to universal service every plant, agency, or facility, all in the sublime sacrifice for country, and not one penny of war profit shall inure to the benefit of private individual, corporation, or combination, but all above the normal shall flow into the defense chest of the Nation. There is something inherently wrong, something out of accord with the ideals of representative democracy, when one portion of our citizenship turns its activities to private gain amid defensive war while another is fighting,sacrificing, or dying for national preservation. 

Out of such universal service will come a new unity of spirit and purpose,a new confidence and consecration, which would make our defense impregnable,our triumph assured. Then we should have little or no disorganization of our economic, industrial, and commercial systems at home, no staggering war debts, no swollen fortunes to flout the sacrifices of our soldiers,no excuse for sedition, no pitiable slackerism, no outrage of treason.Envy and jealousy would have no soil for their menacing development, and revolution would be without the passion which engenders it.

A regret for the mistakes of yesterday must not, however, blind us to the tasks of today. War never left such an aftermath. There has been staggering loss of life and measureless wastage of materials. Nations are still groping for return to stable ways. Discouraging indebtedness confronts us like all the war-torn nations, and these obligations must be provided for. No civilization can survive repudiation. 

We can reduce the abnormal expenditures, and we will. We can strike at war taxation, and we must. We must face the grim necessity, with full knowledge that the task is to be solved, and we must proceed with a full realization that no statute enacted by man can repeal the inexorable laws of nature. Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too much of government,and at the same time do for it too little. We contemplate the immediatet ask of putting our public household in order. We need a rigid and yet sane economy, combined with fiscal justice, and it must be attended by individual prudence and thrift, which are so essential to this trying hour and reassuring for the future. 

The business world reflects the disturbance of war's reaction. Herein flows the lifeblood of material existence. The economic mechanism is intricate and its parts interdependent, and has suffered the shocks and jars incident to abnormal demands, credit inflations, and price upheavals. The normal balances have been impaired, the channels of distribution have been clogged,the relations of labor and management have been strained. We must seek the readjustment with care and courage. Our people must give and take.Prices must reflect the receding fever of war activities. Perhaps we never shall know the old levels of wages again, because war invariably readjusts compensations, and the necessaries of life will show their inseparable relationship, but we must strive for normalcy to reach stability. All the penalties will not be light, nor evenly distributed. There is no way of making them so. There is no instant step from disorder to order. We must face a condition of grim reality, charge off our losses and start afresh.It is the oldest lesson of civilization. I would like government to do all it can to mitigate; then, in understanding, in mutuality of interest,in concern for the common good, our tasks will be solved. No altered system will work a miracle. Any wild experiment will only add to the confusion.Our best assurance lies in efficient administration of our proven system. 

The forward course of the business cycle is unmistakable. Peoples are turning from destruction to production. Industry has sensed the changed order and our own people are turning to resume their normal, onward way.The call is for productive America to go on. I know that Congress and theAdministration will favor every wise Government policy to aid the resumption and encourage continued progress. 

I speak for administrative efficiency, for lightened tax burdens, for sound commercial practices, for adequate credit facilities, for sympathetic concern for all agricultural problems, for the omission of unnecessary interference of Government with business, for an end to Government's experiment in business, and for more efficient business in Government administration.With all of this must attend a mindfulness of the human side of all activities,so that social, industrial, and economic justice will be squared with the purposes of a righteous people. 

With the nation-wide induction of womanhood into our political life,we may count upon her intuitions, her refinements, her intelligence, and her influence to exalt the social order. We count upon her exercise of the full privileges and the performance of the duties of citizenship to speed the attainment of the highest state. 

I wish for an America no less alert in guarding against dangers from within than it is watchful against enemies from without. Our fundamental law recognizes no class, no group, no section; there must be none in legislation or administration. The supreme inspiration is the common weal. Humanity hungers for international peace, and we crave it with all mankind. My most reverent prayer for America is for industrial peace, with its rewards,widely and generally distributed, amid the inspirations of equal opportunity.No one justly may deny the equality of opportunity which made us what we are. We have mistaken unpreparedness to embrace it to be a challenge of the reality, and due concern for making all citizens fit for participation will give added strength of citizenship and magnify our achievement. 

If revolution insists upon overturning established order, let other peoples make the tragic experiment. There is no place for it in America.When World War threatened civilization we pledged our resources and our lives to its preservation, and when revolution threatens we unfurl the flag of law and order and renew our consecration. Ours is a constitutional freedom where the popular will is the law supreme and minorities are sacredly protected. Our revisions, reformations, and evolutions reflect a deliberate judgment and an orderly progress, and we mean to cure our ills, but never destroy or permit destruction by force. 

I had rather submit our industrial controversies to the conference table in advance than to a settlement table after conflict and suffering. The earth is thirsting for the cup of good will, understanding is its fountain source. I would like to acclaim an era of good feeling amid dependable prosperity and all the blessings which attend. 

It has been proved again and again that we cannot, while throwing our markets open to the world, maintain American standards of living and opportunity,and hold our industrial eminence in such unequal competition. There isa luring fallacy in the theory of banished barriers of trade, but preservedAmerican standards require our higher production costs to be reflected in our tariffs on imports. Today, as never before, when peoples are seeking trade restoration and expansion, we must adjust our tariffs to the new order. We seek participation in the world's exchanges, because therein lies our way to widened influence and the triumphs of peace. We know full well we cannot sell where we do not buy, and we cannot sell successfully where we do not carry. Opportunity is calling not alone for the restoration,but for a new era in production, transportation and trade. We shall answer it best by meeting the demand of a surpassing home market, by promoting self- reliance in production, and by bidding enterprise, genius, and efficiency to carry our cargoes in American bottoms to the marts of the world. 

We would not have an America living within and for herself alone, butwe would have her self-reliant, independent, and ever nobler, stronger,and richer. Believing in our higher standards, reared through constitutionalliberty and maintained opportunity, we invite the world to the same heights.But pride in things wrought is no reflex of a completed task. Common welfareis the goal of our national endeavor. Wealth is not inimical to welfare;it ought to be its friendliest agency. There never can be equality of rewardsor possessions so long as the human plan contains varied talents and differingdegrees of industry and thrift, but ours ought to be a country free fromthe great blotches of distressed poverty. We ought to find a way to guardagainst the perils and penalties of unemployment. We want an America ofhomes, illumined with hope and happiness, where mothers, freed from thenecessity for long hours of toil beyond their own doors, may preside asbefits the hearthstone of American citizenship. We want the cradle of Americanchildhood rocked under conditions so wholesome and so hopeful that no blightmay touch it in its development, and we want to provide that no selfishinterest, no material necessity, no lack of opportunity shall prevent thegaining of that education so essential to best citizenship. 

There is no short cut to the making of these ideals into glad realities.The world has witnessed again and again the futility and the mischief ofill-considered remedies for social and economic disorders. But we are mindfultoday as never before of the friction of modern industrialism, and we mustlearn its causes and reduce its evil consequences by sober and tested methods.Where genius has made for great possibilities, justice and happiness mustbe reflected in a greater common welfare. 

Service is the supreme commitment of life. I would rejoice to acclaimthe era of the Golden Rule and crown it with the autocracy of service.I pledge an administration wherein all the agencies of Government are calledto serve, and ever promote an understanding of Government purely as anexpression of the popular will. 

One cannot stand in this presence and be unmindful of the tremendousresponsibility. The world upheaval has added heavily to our tasks. Butwith the realization comes the surge of high resolve, and there is reassurancein belief in the God-given destiny of our Republic. If I felt that thereis to be sole responsibility in the Executive for the America of tomorrowI should shrink from the burden. But here are a hundred millions, withcommon concern and shared responsibility, answerable to God and country.The Republic summons them to their duty, and I invite co-operation. 

I accept my part with single-mindedness of purpose and humility of spirit,and implore the favor and guidance of God in His Heaven. With these I amunafraid, and confidently face the future. 

I have taken the solemn oath of office on that passage of Holy Writwherein it is asked: ""What doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly,and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"" This I plight to Godand country. 
",Inaugural Address,Republican,1,1921,"My Countrymen:  When one surveys the world about him after the great storm, noting the marks of destruction and yet rejoicing in the ruggedness of the things which withstood it, if he is an American he breathes the clarified atmosphere with a strange mingling of regret and new hope. We have seen a world passion spend its fury, but we contemplate our Republic unshaken, and hold our civilization secure. Liberty--liberty within the law--and civilization are inseparable, and though both were threatened we find them now secure;and there comes to Americans the profound assurance that our representative government is the highest expression and surest guaranty of both.  Standing in this presence, mindful of the solemnity of this occasion,feeling the emotions which no one may know until he senses the great weight of responsibility for himself, I must utter my belief in the divine inspiration of the founding fathers. Surely there must have been God's intent in the making of this new-world Republic. Ours is an organic law which had but one ambiguity, and we saw that effaced in a baptism of sacrifice and blood,with union maintained, the Nation supreme, and its concord inspiring. We have seen the world rivet its hopeful gaze on the great truths on which the founders wrought. We have seen civil, human, and religious liberty verified and glorified. In the beginning the Old World scoffed at our experiment;today our foundations of political and social belief stand unshaken, a precious inheritance to ourselves, an inspiring example of freedom and civilization to all mankind.

new-world republic. ours is an organic law which had but one ambiguity, and we saw that effaced in a baptism of sacrifice and blood,with union maintained, the nation supreme, and its concord inspiring. we have seen the world rivet its hopeful gaze on the great truths on which the founders wrought. we have seen civil, human, and religious liberty verified and glorified. in the beginning the old world scoffed at our experiment;today our foundations of political and social belief stand unshaken, a precious inheritance to ourselves, an inspiring example of freedom and civilization to all mankind. let us express renewed and strengthened devotion,in grateful reverence for the immortal beginning, and utter our confidence in the supreme fulfillment.  the recorded progress of our republic, materially and spiritually, in itself proves the wisdom of the inherited policy of noninvolvement in oldworld affairs. confident of our ability to work out our own destiny, and jealously guarding our right to do so, we seek no part in directing the destinies of the old world. we do not mean to be entangled. we will accept no responsibility except as our own conscience and judgment, in each instance,may determine.  our eyes never will be blind to a developing menace, our ears never deaf to the call of civilization. we recognize the new order in the world,with the closer contacts which progress has wrought. we sense the call of the human heart for fellowship, fraternity, and cooperation. we crave friendship and harbor no hate. but america, our america, the america builded on the foundation laid by the inspired fathers, can be a party to no permanent military alliance. it can enter into no political commitments, nor assume any economic obligations which will subject our decisions to any other than our own authority.  i am sure our own people will not misunderstand, nor will the world misconstrue. we have no thought to impede the paths to closer relationship.we wish to promote understanding. we want to do our part in making offensive warfare so hateful that governments and peoples who resort to it must prove the righteousness of their cause or stand as outlaws before the bar of civilization.  we are ready to associate ourselves with the nations of the world, great and small, for conference, for counsel; to seek the expressed views of world opinion; to recommend a way to approximate disarmament and relieve the crushing burdens of military and naval establishments. we elect to participate in suggesting plans for mediation, conciliation, and arbitration,and would gladly join in that expressed conscience of progress, which seeks to clarify and write the laws of international relationship, and establish a world court for the disposition of such justiciable questions as nations are agreed to submit thereto. in expressing aspirations, in seeking practical plans, in translating humanity's new concept of righteousness and justice and its hatred of war into recommended action we are ready most heartily to unite, but every commitment must be made in the exercise of our national sovereignty. since freedom impelled, and independence inspired, and nationality exalted, a world super government is contrary to everything we cherish and can have no sanction by our republic. this is not selfishness, it is sanctity.it is not aloofness, it is security. it is not suspicion of others, it is patriotic adherence to the things which made us what we are.  today, better than ever before, we know the aspirations of humankind,and share them. we have come to a new realization of our place in the world and a new appraisal of our nation by the world. the unselfishness of theseunited states is a thing proven; our devotion to peace for ourselves and for the world is well established; our concern for preserved civilization has had its impassioned and heroic expression. there was no american failure to resist the attempted reversion of civilization; there will be no failure today or tomorrow.  the success of our popular government rests wholly upon the correct interpretation of the deliberate, intelligent, dependable popular will of america. in a deliberate questioning of a suggested change of national policy, where internationality was to supersede nationality, we turned to a referendum, to the american people. there was ample discussion, and there is a public mandate in manifest understanding.  america is ready to encourage, eager to initiate, anxious to participate in any seemly program likely to lessen the probability of war, and promote that brotherhood of mankind which must be god's highest conception of human relationship. because we cherish ideals of justice and peace, because we appraise international comity and helpful relationship no less highly than any people of the world, we aspire to a high place in the moral leadership of civilization, and we hold a maintained america, the proven republic,the unshaken temple of representative democracy, to be not only an inspiration and example, but the highest agency of strengthening good will and promoting accord on both continents.  mankind needs a world-wide benediction of understanding. it is needed among individuals, among peoples, among governments, and it will inaugurate an era of good feeling to make the birth of a new order. in such understanding men will strive confidently for the promotion of their better relationships and nations will promote the comities so essential to peace.  we must understand that ties of trade bind nations in closest intimacy,and none may receive except as he gives. we have not strengthened ours in accordance with our resources or our genius, notably on our own continent,where a galaxy of republics reflects the glory of new-world democracy,but in the new order of finance and trade we mean to promote enlarged activities and seek expanded confidence.  perhaps we can make no more helpful contribution by example than prove a republic's capacity to emerge from the wreckage of war. while the world's embittered travail did not leave us devastated lands nor desolated cities,left no gaping wounds, no breast with hate, it did involve us in the delirium of expenditure, in expanded currency and credits, in unbalanced industry,in unspeakable waste, and disturbed relationships. while it uncovered our portion of hateful selfishness at home, it also revealed the heart of america as sound and fearless, and beating in confidence unfailing.  amid it all we have riveted the gaze of all civilization to the unselfishness and the righteousness of representative democracy, where our freedom never has made offensive warfare, never has sought territorial aggrandizement through force, never has turned to the arbitrament of arms until reason has been exhausted. when the governments of the earth shall have established a freedom like our own and shall have sanctioned the pursuit of peace as we have practiced it, i believe the last sorrow and the final sacrifice of international warfare will have been written.  let me speak to the maimed and wounded soldiers who are present today,and through them convey to their comrades the gratitude of the republic for their sacrifices in its defense. a generous country will never forget the services you rendered, and you may hope for a policy under government that will relieve any maimed successors from taking your places on another such occasion as this.  our supreme task is the resumption of our onward, normal way. reconstruction,readjustment, restoration all these must follow. i would like to hasten them. if it will lighten the spirit and add to the resolution with which we take up the task, let me repeat for our nation, we shall give no people just cause to make war upon us; we hold no national prejudices; we entertain no spirit of revenge; we do not hate; we do not covet; we dream of no conquest,nor boast of armed prowess.  if, despite this attitude, war is again forced upon us, i earnestly hope a way may be found which will unify our individual and collective strength and consecrate all america, materially and spiritually, body and soul, to national defense. i can vision the ideal republic, where everyman and woman is called under the flag for assignment to duty for whatever service, military or civic, the individual is best fitted; where we may call to universal service every plant, agency, or facility, all in the sublime sacrifice for country, and not one penny of war profit shall inure to the benefit of private individual, corporation, or combination, but all above the normal shall flow into the defense chest of the nation. there is something inherently wrong, something out of accord with the ideals of representative democracy, when one portion of our citizenship turns its activities to private gain amid defensive war while another is fighting,sacrificing, or dying for national preservation.  out of such universal service will come a new unity of spirit and purpose,a new confidence and consecration, which would make our defense impregnable,our triumph assured. then we should have little or no disorganization of our economic, industrial, and commercial systems at home, no staggering war debts, no swollen fortunes to flout the sacrifices of our soldiers,no excuse for sedition, no pitiable slackerism, no outrage of treason.envy and jealousy would have no soil for their menacing development, and revolution would be without the passion which engenders it. a regret for the mistakes of yesterday must not, however, blind us to the tasks of today. war never left such an aftermath. there has been staggering loss of life and measureless wastage of materials. nations are still groping for return to stable ways. discouraging indebtedness confronts us like all the war-torn nations, and these obligations must be provided for. no civilization can survive repudiation.  we can reduce the abnormal expenditures, and we will. we can strike at war taxation, and we must. we must face the grim necessity, with full knowledge that the task is to be solved, and we must proceed with a full realization that no statute enacted by man can repeal the inexorable laws of nature. our most dangerous tendency is to expect too much of government,and at the same time do for it too little. we contemplate the immediatet ask of putting our public household in order. we need a rigid and yet sane economy, combined with fiscal justice, and it must be attended by individual prudence and thrift, which are so essential to this trying hour and reassuring for the future.  the business world reflects the disturbance of war's reaction. herein flows the lifeblood of material existence. the economic mechanism is intricate and its parts interdependent, and has suffered the shocks and jars incident to abnormal demands, credit inflations, and price upheavals. the normal balances have been impaired, the channels of distribution have been clogged,the relations of labor and management have been strained. we must seek the readjustment with care and courage. our people must give and take.prices must reflect the receding fever of war activities. perhaps we never shall know the old levels of wages again, because war invariably readjusts compensations, and the necessaries of life will show their inseparable relationship, but we must strive for normalcy to reach stability. all the penalties will not be light, nor evenly distributed. there is no way of making them so. there is no instant step from disorder to order. we must face a condition of grim reality, charge off our losses and start afresh.it is the oldest lesson of civilization. i would like government to do all it can to mitigate; then, in understanding, in mutuality of interest,in concern for the common good, our tasks will be solved. no altered system will work a miracle. any wild experiment will only add to the confusion.our best assurance lies in efficient administration of our proven system.  the forward course of the business cycle is unmistakable. peoples are turning from destruction to production. industry has sensed the changed order and our own people are turning to resume their normal, onward way.the call is for productive america to go on. i know that congress and theadministration will favor every wise government policy to aid the resumption and encourage continued progress.  i speak for administrative efficiency, for lightened tax burdens, for sound commercial practices, for adequate credit facilities, for sympathetic concern for all agricultural problems, for the omission of unnecessary interference of government with business, for an end to government's experiment in business, and for more efficient business in government administration.with all of this must attend a mindfulness of the human side of all activities,so that social, industrial, and economic justice will be squared with the purposes of a righteous people.  with the nation-wide induction of womanhood into our political life,we may count upon her intuitions, her refinements, her intelligence, and her influence to exalt the social order. we count upon her exercise of the full privileges and the performance of the duties of citizenship to speed the attainment of the highest state.  i wish for an america no less alert in guarding against dangers from within than it is watchful against enemies from without. our fundamental law recognizes no class, no group, no section; there must be none in legislation or administration. the supreme inspiration is the common weal. humanity hungers for international peace, and we crave it with all mankind. my most reverent prayer for america is for industrial peace, with its rewards,widely and generally distributed, amid the inspirations of equal opportunity.no one justly may deny the equality of opportunity which made us what we are. we have mistaken unpreparedness to embrace it to be a challenge of the reality, and due concern for making all citizens fit for participation will give added strength of citizenship and magnify our achievement.  if revolution insists upon overturning established order, let other peoples make the tragic experiment. there is no place for it in america.when world war threatened civilization we pledged our resources and our lives to its preservation, and when revolution threatens we unfurl the flag of law and order and renew our consecration. ours is a constitutional freedom where the popular will is the law supreme and minorities are sacredly protected. our revisions, reformations, and evolutions reflect a deliberate judgment and an orderly progress, and we mean to cure our ills, but never destroy or permit destruction by force.  i had rather submit our industrial controversies to the conference table in advance than to a settlement table after conflict and suffering. the earth is thirsting for the cup of good will, understanding is its fountain source. i would like to acclaim an era of good feeling amid dependable prosperity and all the blessings which attend.  it has been proved again and again that we cannot, while throwing our markets open to the world, maintain american standards of living and opportunity,and hold our industrial eminence in such unequal competition. there isa luring fallacy in the theory of banished barriers of trade, but preservedamerican standards require our higher production costs to be reflected in our tariffs on imports. today, as never before, when peoples are seeking trade restoration and expansion, we must adjust our tariffs to the new order. we seek participation in the world's exchanges, because therein lies our way to widened influence and the triumphs of peace. we know full well we cannot sell where we do not buy, and we cannot sell successfully where we do not carry. opportunity is calling not alone for the restoration,but for a new era in production, transportation and trade. we shall answer it best by meeting the demand of a surpassing home market, by promoting self- reliance in production, and by bidding enterprise, genius, and efficiency to carry our cargoes in american bottoms to the marts of the world.  we would not have an america living within and for herself alone, butwe would have her self-reliant, independent, and ever nobler, stronger,and richer. believing in our higher standards, reared through constitutionalliberty and maintained opportunity, we invite the world to the same heights.but pride in things wrought is no reflex of a completed task. common welfareis the goal of our national endeavor. wealth is not inimical to welfare;it ought to be its friendliest agency. there never can be equality of rewardsor possessions so long as the human plan contains varied talents and differingdegrees of industry and thrift, but ours ought to be a country free fromthe great blotches of distressed poverty. we ought to find a way to guardagainst the perils and penalties of unemployment. we want an america ofhomes, illumined with hope and happiness, where mothers, freed from thenecessity for long hours of toil beyond their own doors, may preside asbefits the hearthstone of american citizenship. we want the cradle of americanchildhood rocked under conditions so wholesome and so hopeful that no blightmay touch it in its development, and we want to provide that no selfishinterest, no material necessity, no lack of opportunity shall prevent thegaining of that education so essential to best citizenship.  there is no short cut to the making of these ideals into glad realities.the world has witnessed again and again the futility and the mischief ofill-considered remedies for social and economic disorders. but we are mindfultoday as never before of the friction of modern industrialism, and we mustlearn its causes and reduce its evil consequences by sober and tested methods.where genius has made for great possibilities, justice and happiness mustbe reflected in a greater common welfare.  service is the supreme commitment of life. i would rejoice to acclaimthe era of the golden rule and crown it with the autocracy of service.i pledge an administration wherein all the agencies of government are calledto serve, and ever promote an understanding of government purely as anexpression of the popular will.  one cannot stand in this presence and be unmindful of the tremendousresponsibility. the world upheaval has added heavily to our tasks. butwith the realization comes the surge of high resolve, and there is reassurancein belief in the god-given destiny of our republic. if i felt that thereis to be sole responsibility in the executive for the america of tomorrowi should shrink from the burden. but here are a hundred millions, withcommon concern and shared responsibility, answerable to god and country.the republic summons them to their duty, and i invite co-operation.  i accept my part with single-mindedness of purpose and humility of spirit,and implore the favor and guidance of god in his heaven. with these i amunafraid, and confidently face the future.  i have taken the solemn oath of office on that passage of holy writwherein it is asked: ""what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly,and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy god?"" this i plight to godand country.   ","my countrymen  when one surveys the world about him after the great storm noting the marks of destruction and yet rejoicing in the ruggedness of the things which withstood it if he is an american he breathes the clarified atmosphere with a strange mingling of regret and new hope we have seen a world passion spend its fury but we contemplate our republic unshaken and hold our civilization

subject our decisions to any other than our own authority  i am sure our own people will not misunderstand nor will the world misconstrue we have no thought to impede the paths to closer relationshipwe wish to promote understanding we want to do our part in making offensive warfare so hateful that governments and peoples who resort to it must prove the righteousness of their cause or stand as outlaws before the bar of civilization  we are ready to associate ourselves with the nations of the world great and small for conference for counsel to seek the expressed views of world opinion to recommend a way to approximate disarmament and relieve the crushing burdens of military and naval establishments we elect to participate in suggesting plans for mediation conciliation and arbitrationand would gladly join in that expressed conscience of progress which seeks to clarify and write the laws of international relationship and establish a world court for the disposition of such justiciable questions as nations are agreed to submit thereto in expressing aspirations in seeking practical plans in translating humanity new concept of righteousness and justice and its hatred of war into recommended action we are ready most heartily to unite but every commitment must be made in the exercise of our national sovereignty since freedom impelled and independence inspired and nationality exalted a world super government is contrary to everything we cherish and can have no sanction by our republic this is not selfishness it is sanctityit is not aloofness it is security it is not suspicion of others it is patriotic adherence to the things which made us what we are  today better than ever before we know the aspirations of humankindand share them we have come to a new realization of our place in the world and a new appraisal of our nation by the world the unselfishness of theseunited states is a thing proven our devotion to peace for ourselves and for the world is well established our concern for preserved civilization has had its impassioned and heroic expression there was no american failure to resist the attempted reversion of civilization there will be no failure today or tomorrow  the success of our popular government rests wholly upon the correct interpretation of the deliberate intelligent dependable popular will of america in a deliberate questioning of a suggested change of national policy where internationality was to supersede nationality we turned to a referendum to the american people there was ample discussion and there is a public mandate in manifest understanding  america is ready to encourage eager to initiate anxious to participate in any seemly program likely to lessen the probability of war and promote that brotherhood of mankind which must be god highest conception of human relationship because we cherish ideals of justice and peace because we appraise international comity and helpful relationship no less highly than any people of the world we aspire to a high place in the moral leadership of civilization and we hold a maintained america the proven republicthe unshaken temple of representative democracy to be not only an inspiration and example but the highest agency of strengthening good will and promoting accord on both continents  mankind needs a world-wide benediction of understanding it is needed among individuals among peoples among governments and it will inaugurate an era of good feeling to make the birth of a new order in such understanding men will strive confidently for the promotion of their better relationships and nations will promote the comities so essential to peace  we must understand that ties of trade bind nations in closest intimacyand none may receive except as he gives we have not strengthened ours in accordance with our resources or our genius notably on our own continentwhere a galaxy of republics reflects the glory of new-world democracybut in the new order of finance and trade we mean to promote enlarged activities and seek expanded confidence  perhaps we can make no more helpful contribution by example than prove a republic capacity to emerge from the wreckage of war while the world embittered travail did not leave us devastated lands nor desolated citiesleft no gaping wounds no breast with hate it did involve us in the delirium of expenditure in expanded currency and credits in unbalanced industryin unspeakable waste and disturbed relationships while it uncovered our portion of hateful selfishness at home it also revealed the heart of america as sound and fearless and beating in confidence unfailing  amid it all we have riveted the gaze of all civilization to the unselfishness and the righteousness of representative democracy where our freedom never has made offensive warfare never has sought territorial aggrandizement through force never has turned to the arbitrament of arms until reason has been exhausted when the governments of the earth shall have established a freedom like our own and shall have sanctioned the pursuit of peace as we have practiced it i believe the last sorrow and the final sacrifice of international warfare will have been written  let me speak to the maimed and wounded soldiers who are present todayand through them convey to their comrades the gratitude of the republic for their sacrifices in its defense a generous country will never forget the services you rendered and you may hope for a policy under government that will relieve any maimed successors from taking your places on another such occasion as this  our supreme task is the resumption of our onward normal way reconstructionreadjustment restoration all these must follow i would like to hasten them if it will lighten the spirit and add to the resolution with which we take up the task let me repeat for our nation we shall give no people just cause to make war upon us we hold no national prejudices we entertain no spirit of revenge we do not hate we do not covet we dream of no conquestnor boast of armed prowess  if despite this attitude war is again forced upon us i earnestly hope a way may be found which will unify our individual and collective strength and consecrate all america materially and spiritually body and soul to national defense i can vision the ideal republic where everyman and woman is called under the flag for assignment to duty for whatever service military or civic the individual is best fitted where we may call to universal service every plant agency or facility all in the sublime sacrifice for country and not one penny of war profit shall inure to the benefit of private individual corporation or combination but all above the normal shall flow into the defense chest of the nation there is something inherently wrong something out of accord with the ideals of representative democracy when one portion of our citizenship turns its activities to private gain amid defensive war while another is fightingsacrificing or dying for national preservation  out of such universal service will come a new unity of spirit and purposea new confidence and consecration which would make our defense impregnableour triumph assured then we should have little or no disorganization of our economic industrial and commercial systems at home no staggering war debts no swollen fortunes to flout the sacrifices of our soldiersno excuse for sedition no pitiable slackerism no outrage of treasonenvy and jealousy would have no soil for their menacing development and revolution would be without the passion which engenders it a regret for the mistakes of yesterday must not however blind us to the tasks of today war never left such an aftermath there has been staggering loss of life and measureless wastage of materials nations are still groping for return to stable ways discouraging indebtedness confronts us like all the war-torn nations and these obligations must be provided for no civilization can survive repudiation  we can reduce the abnormal expenditures and we will we can strike at war taxation and we must we must face the grim necessity with full knowledge that the task is to be solved and we must proceed with a full realization that no statute enacted by man can repeal the inexorable laws of nature our most dangerous tendency is to expect too much of governmentand at the same time do for it too little we contemplate the immediatet ask of putting our public household in order we need a rigid and yet sane economy combined with fiscal justice and it must be attended by individual prudence and thrift which are so essential to this trying hour and reassuring for the future  the business world reflects the disturbance of war reaction herein flows the lifeblood of material existence the economic mechanism is intricate and its parts interdependent and has suffered the shocks and jars incident to abnormal demands credit inflations and price upheavals the normal balances have been impaired the channels of distribution have been cloggedthe relations of labor and management have been strained we must seek the readjustment with care and courage our people must give and takeprices must reflect the receding fever of war activities perhaps we never shall know the old levels of wages again because war invariably readjusts compensations and the necessaries of life will show their inseparable relationship but we must strive for normalcy to reach stability all the penalties will not be light nor evenly distributed there is no way of making them so there is no instant step from disorder to order we must face a condition of grim reality charge off our losses and start afreshit is the oldest lesson of civilization i would like government to do all it can to mitigate then in understanding in mutuality of interestin concern for the common good our tasks will be solved no altered system will work a miracle any wild experiment will only add to the confusionour best assurance lies in efficient administration of our proven system  the forward course of the business cycle is unmistakable peoples are turning from destruction to production industry has sensed the changed order and our own people are turning to resume their normal onward waythe call is for productive america to go on i know that congress and theadministration will favor every wise government policy to aid the resumption and encourage continued progress  i speak for administrative efficiency for lightened tax burdens for sound commercial practices for adequate credit facilities for sympathetic concern for all agricultural problems for the omission of unnecessary interference of government with business for an end to government experiment in business and for more efficient business in government administrationwith all of this must attend a mindfulness of the human side of all activitiesso that social industrial and economic justice will be squared with the purposes of a righteous people  with the nation-wide induction of womanhood into our political lifewe may count upon her intuitions her refinements her intelligence and her influence to exalt the social order we count upon her exercise of the full privileges and the performance of the duties of citizenship to speed the attainment of the highest state  i wish for an america no less alert in guarding against dangers from within than it is watchful against enemies from without our fundamental law recognizes no class no group no section there must be none in legislation or administration the supreme inspiration is the common weal humanity hungers for international peace and we crave it with all mankind my most reverent prayer for america is for industrial peace with its rewardswidely and generally distributed amid the inspirations of equal opportunityno one justly may deny the equality of opportunity which made us what we are we have mistaken unpreparedness to embrace it to be a challenge of the reality and due concern for making all citizens fit for participation will give added strength of citizenship and magnify our achievement  if revolution insists upon overturning established order let other peoples make the tragic experiment there is no place for it in americawhen world war threatened civilization we pledged our resources and our lives to its preservation and when revolution threatens we unfurl the flag of law and order and renew our consecration ours is a constitutional freedom where the popular will is the law supreme and minorities are sacredly protected our revisions reformations and evolutions reflect a deliberate judgment and an orderly progress and we mean to cure our ills but never destroy or permit destruction by force  i had rather submit our industrial controversies to the conference table in advance than to a settlement table after conflict and suffering the earth is thirsting for the cup of good will understanding is its fountain source i would like to acclaim an era of good feeling amid dependable prosperity and all the blessings which attend  it has been proved again and again that we cannot while throwing our markets open to the world maintain american standards of living and opportunityand hold our industrial eminence in such unequal competition there isa luring fallacy in the theory of banished barriers of trade but preservedamerican standards require our higher production costs to be reflected in our tariffs on imports today as never before when peoples are seeking trade restoration and expansion we must adjust our tariffs to the new order we seek participation in the world exchanges because therein lies our way to widened influence and the triumphs of peace we know full well we cannot sell where we do not buy and we cannot sell successfully where we do not carry opportunity is calling not alone for the restorationbut for a new era in production transportation and trade we shall answer it best by meeting the demand of a surpassing home market by promoting self- reliance in production and by bidding enterprise genius and efficiency to carry our cargoes in american bottoms to the marts of the world  we would not have an america living within and for herself alone butwe would have her self-reliant independent and ever nobler strongerand richer believing in our higher standards reared through constitutionalliberty and maintained opportunity we invite the world to the same heightsbut pride in things wrought is no reflex of a completed task common welfareis the goal of our national endeavor wealth is not inimical to welfareit ought to be its friendliest agency there never can be equality of rewardsor possessions so long as the human plan contains varied talents and differingdegrees of industry and thrift but ours ought to be a country free fromthe great blotches of distressed poverty we ought to find a way to guardagainst the perils and penalties of unemployment we want an america ofhomes illumined with hope and happiness where mothers freed from thenecessity for long hours of toil beyond their own doors may preside asbefits the hearthstone of american citizenship we want the cradle of americanchildhood rocked under conditions so wholesome and so hopeful that no blightmay touch it in its development and we want to provide that no selfishinterest no material necessity no lack of opportunity shall prevent thegaining of that education so essential to best citizenship  there is no short cut to the making of these ideals into glad realitiesthe world has witnessed again and again the futility and the mischief ofill-considered remedies for social and economic disorders but we are mindfultoday as never before of the friction of modern industrialism and we mustlearn its causes and reduce its evil consequences by sober and tested methodswhere genius has made for great possibilities justice and happiness mustbe reflected in a greater common welfare  service is the supreme commitment of life i would rejoice to acclaimthe era of the golden rule and crown it with the autocracy of servicei pledge an administration wherein all the agencies of government are calledto serve and ever promote an understanding of government purely as anexpression of the popular will  one cannot stand in this presence and be unmindful of the tremendousresponsibility the world upheaval has added heavily to our tasks butwith the realization comes the surge of high resolve and there is reassurancein belief in the god-given destiny of our republic if i felt that thereis to be sole responsibility in the executive for the america of tomorrowi should shrink from the burden but here are a hundred millions withcommon concern and shared responsibility answerable to god and countrythe republic summons them to their duty and i invite co-operation  i accept my part with single-mindedness of purpose and humility of spiritand implore the favor and guidance of god in his heaven with these i amunafraid and confidently face the future  i have taken the solemn oath of office on that passage of holy writwherein it is asked ""what doth the lord require of thee but to do justlyand to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god"" this i plight to godand country   ","my countrymen  when one survey the world about him after the great storm note the mark of destruction and yet rejoice in the ruggedness of the things which withstand it if he be an american he breathe the clarify atmosphere with a strange mingle of regret and new hope we have see a world passion spend its fury but we contemplate our republic unshaken and hold our civilization secure liberty--liberty within the law--and

peace, with its rewards,widely and generally distributed, amid the inspirations of equal opportunity.no one justly may deny the equality of opportunity which made us what we are.', 'we have mistaken unpreparedness to embrace it to be a challenge of the reality, and due concern for making all citizens fit for participation will give added strength of citizenship and magnify our achievement.', 'if revolution insists upon overturning established order, let other peoples make the tragic experiment.', 'there is no place for it in america.when world war threatened civilization we pledged our

Woodrow Wilson,"March 05, 1917","My Fellow Citizens: 

The four years which have elapsed since last I stood in this place havebeen crowded with counsel and action of the most vital interest and consequence.Perhaps no equal period in our history has been so fruitful of importantreforms in our economic and industrial life or so full of significant changesin the spirit and purpose of our political action. We have sought verythoughtfully to set our house in order, correct the grosser errors andabuses of our industrial life, liberate and quicken the processes of ournational genius and energy, and lift our politics to a broader view ofthe people's essential interests. 

It is a record of singular variety and singular distinction. But I shallnot attempt to review it. It speaks for itself and will be of increasinginfluence as the years go by. This is not the time for retrospect. It istime rather to speak our thoughts and purposes concerning the present andthe immediate future. 

Although we have centered counsel and action with such unusual concentrationand success upon the great problems of domestic legislation to which weaddressed ourselves four years ago, other matters have more and more forcedthemselves upon our attention-- matters lying outside our own life as anation and over which we had no control, but which, despite our wish tokeep free of them, have drawn us more and more irresistibly into theirown current and influence. 

It has been impossible to avoid them. They have affected the life ofthe whole world. They have shaken men everywhere with a passion and anapprehension they never knew before. It has been hard to preserve calmcounsel while the thought of our own people swayed this way and that undertheir influence. We are a composite and cosmopolitan people. We are ofthe blood of all the nations that are at war. The currents of our thoughtsas well as the currents of our trade run quick at all seasons back andforth between us and them. The war inevitably set its mark from the firstalike upon our minds, our industries, our commerce, our politics and oursocial action. To be indifferent to it, or independent of it, was out ofthe question. 

And yet all the while we have been conscious that we were not part ofit. In that consciousness, despite many divisions, we have drawn closertogether. We have been deeply wronged upon the seas, but we have not wishedto wrong or injure in return; have retained throughout the consciousnessof standing in some sort apart, intent upon an interest that transcendedthe immediate issues of the war itself. 

As some of the injuries done us have become intolerable we have stillbeen clear that we wished nothing for ourselves that we were not readyto demand for all mankind--fair dealing, justice, the freedom to live andto be at ease against organized wrong. 

It is in this spirit and with this thought that we have grown more andmore aware, more and more certain that the part we wished to play was thepart of those who mean to vindicate and fortify peace. We have been obligedto arm ourselves to make good our claim to a certain minimum of right andof freedom of action. We stand firm in armed neutrality since it seemsthat in no other way we can demonstrate what it is we insist upon and cannotforget. We may even be drawn on, by circumstances, not by our own purposeor desire, to a more active assertion of our rights as we see them anda more immediate association with the great struggle itself. But nothingwill alter our thought or our purpose. They are too clear to be obscured.They are too deeply rooted in the principles of our national life to bealtered. We desire neither conquest nor advantage. We wish nothing thatcan be had only at the cost of another people. We always professed unselfishpurpose and we covet the opportunity to prove our professions are sincere. 

There are many things still to be done at home, to clarify our own politicsand add new vitality to the industrial processes of our own life, and weshall do them as time and opportunity serve, but we realize that the greatestthings that remain to be done must be done with the whole world for stageand in cooperation with the wide and universal forces of mankind, and weare making our spirits ready for those things. 

We are provincials no longer. The tragic events of the thirty monthsof vital turmoil through which we have just passed have made us citizensof the world. There can be no turning back. Our own fortunes as a nationare involved whether we would have it so or not. 

And yet we are not the less Americans on that account. We shall be themore American if we but remain true to the principles in which we havebeen bred. They are not the principles of a province or of a single continent.We have known and boasted all along that they were the principles of aliberated mankind. These, therefore, are the things we shall stand for,whether in war or in peace: 

That all nations are equally interested in the peace of the world andin the political stability of free peoples, and equally responsible fortheir maintenance; that the essential principle of peace is the actualequality of nations in all matters of right or privilege; that peace cannotsecurely or justly rest upon an armed balance of power; that governmentsderive all their just powers from the consent of the governed and thatno other powers should be supported by the common thought, purpose or powerof the family of nations; that the seas should be equally free and safefor the use of all peoples, under rules set up by common agreement andconsent, and that, so far as practicable, they should be accessible toall upon equal terms; that national armaments shall be limited to the necessitiesof national order and domestic safety; that the community of interest andof power upon which peace must henceforth depend imposes upon each nationthe duty of seeing to it that all influences proceeding from its own citizensmeant to encourage or assist revolution in other states should be sternlyand effectually suppressed and prevented. 

I need not argue these principles to you, my fellow countrymen; theyare your own part and parcel of your own thinking and your own motivesin affairs. They spring up native amongst us. Upon this as a platform ofpurpose and of action we can stand together. And it is imperative thatwe should stand together. We are being forged into a new unity amidst thefires that now blaze throughout the world. In their ardent heat we shall,in God's Providence, let us hope, be purged of faction and division, purifiedof the errant humors of party and of private interest, and shall standforth in the days to come with a new dignity of national pride and spirit.Let each man see to it that the dedication is in his own heart, the highpurpose of the nation in his own mind, ruler of his own will and desire. 

I stand here and have taken the high and solemn oath to which you havebeen audience because the people of the United States have chosen me forthis august delegation of power and have by their gracious judgment namedme their leader in affairs. 

I know now what the task means. I realize to the full the responsibilitywhich it involves. I pray God I may be given the wisdom and the prudenceto do my duty in the true spirit of this great people. I am their servantand can succeed only as they sustain and guide me by their confidence andtheir counsel. The thing I shall count upon, the thing without which neithercounsel nor action will avail, is the unity of America--an America unitedin feeling, in purpose and in its vision of duty, of opportunity and ofservice. 

We are to beware of all men who would turn the tasks and the necessitiesof the nation to their own private profit or use them for the buildingup of private power. 

United alike in the conception of our duty and in the high resolve toperform it in the face of all men, let us dedicate ourselves to the greattask to which we must now set our hand. For myself I beg your tolerance,your countenance and your united aid. 

The shadows that now lie dark upon our path will soon be dispelled,and we shall walk with the light all about us if we be but true to ourselves--toourselves as we have wished to be known in the counsels of the world andin the thought of all those who love liberty and justice and the rightexalted. ",Inaugural Address,Democrat,0,1917,"My Fellow Citizens:  The four years which have elapsed since last I stood in this place havebeen crowded with counsel and action of the most vital interest and consequence.Perhaps no equal period in our history has been so fruitful of importantreforms in our economic and industrial life or so full of significant changesin the spirit and purpose of our political action. We have sought verythoughtfully to set our house in order, correct the grosser errors andabuses of our industrial life, liberate and quicken the processes of ournational genius and energy, and lift our politics to a broader view ofthe people's essential interests.  It is a record of singular variety and singular distinction. But I shallnot attempt to review it. It speaks for itself and will be of increasinginfluence as the years go by. This is not the time for retrospect. It istime rather to speak our thoughts and purposes concerning the present andthe immediate future.  Although we have centered counsel and action with such unusual concentrationand success upon the great problems of domestic legislation to which weaddressed ourselves four years ago, other matters have more and more forcedthemselves upon our attention-- matters lying outside our own life as anation and over which we had no control, but which, despite our wish tokeep free of them, have drawn us more and more irresistibly into theirown current and influence.  It has been impossible to avoid them. They have affected the life ofthe whole world. They have shaken men everywhere with a passion and anapprehension they never knew before. It has been hard to preserve calmcounsel while the thought of our own people swayed this way and that undertheir influence. We are a composite and cosmopolitan people. We are ofthe blood of all the nations that are at war. The currents of our thoughtsas well as the currents of our trade run quick at all seasons back andforth between us and them. The war inevitably set its mark from the firstalike upon our minds, our industries, our commerce, our politics and oursocial action. To be indifferent to it, or independent of it, was out ofthe question.  And yet all the while we have been conscious that we were not part ofit. In that consciousness, despite many divisions, we have drawn closertogether. We have been deeply wronged upon the seas, but we have not wishedto wrong or injure in return; have retained throughout the consciousnessof standing in some sort apart, intent upon an interest that transcendedthe immediate issues of the war itself.  As some of the injuries done us have become intolerable we have stillbeen clear that we wished nothing for ourselves that we were not readyto demand for all mankind--fair dealing, justice, the freedom to live andto be at ease against organized wrong.  It is in this spirit and with this thought that we have grown more andmore aware, more and more certain that the part we wished to play was thepart of those who mean to vindicate and fortify peace. We have been obligedto arm ourselves to make good our claim to a certain minimum of right andof freedom of action. We stand firm in armed neutrality since it seemsthat in no other way we can demonstrate what it is we insist upon and cannotforget. We may even be drawn on, by circumstances, not by our own purposeor desire, to a more active assertion of our rights as we see them anda more immediate association with the great struggle itself. But nothingwill alter our thought or our purpose. They are too clear to be obscured.They are too deeply rooted in the principles of our national life to bealtered. We desire neither conquest nor advantage. We wish nothing thatcan be had only at the cost of another people. We always professed unselfishpurpose and we covet the opportunity to prove our professions are sincere.  There are many things still to be done at home, to clarify our own politicsand add new vitality to the industrial processes of our own life, and weshall do them as time and opportunity serve, but we realize that the greatestthings that remain to be done must be done with the whole world for stageand in cooperation with the wide and universal forces of mankind, and weare making our spirits ready for those things.

Woodrow Wilson,"March 04, 1913","There has been a change of government. It began two years ago, whenthe House of Representatives became Democratic by a decisive majority.It has now been completed. The Senate about to assemble will also be Democratic.The offices of President and Vice-President have been put into the handsof Democrats. What does the change mean? That is the question that is uppermostin our minds to-day. That is the question I am going to try to answer,in order, if I may, to interpret the occasion. 

It means much more than the mere success of a party. The success ofa party means little except when the Nation is using that party for a largeand definite purpose. No one can mistake the purpose for which the Nationnow seeks to use the Democratic Party. It seeks to use it to interpreta change in its own plans and point of view. Some old things with whichwe had grown familiar, and which had begun to creep into the very habitof our thought and of our lives, have altered their aspect as we have latterlylooked critically upon them, with fresh, awakened eyes; have dropped theirdisguises and shown themselves alien and sinister. Some new things, aswe look frankly upon them, willing to comprehend their real character,have come to assume the aspect of things long believed in and familiar,stuff of our own convictions. We have been refreshed by a new insight intoour own life. 

We see that in many things that life is very great. It is incomparablygreat in its material aspects, in its body of wealth, in the diversityand sweep of its energy, in the industries which have been conceived andbuilt up by the genius of individual men and the limitless enterprise ofgroups of men. It is great, also, very great, in its moral force. Nowhereelse in the world have noble men and women exhibited in more striking formsthe beauty and the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and counsel in theirefforts to rectify wrong, alleviate suffering, and set the weak in theway of strength and hope. We have built up, moreover, a great system ofgovernment, which has stood through a long age as in many respects a modelfor those who seek to set liberty upon foundations that will endure againstfortuitous change, against storm and accident. Our life contains everygreat thing, and contains it in rich abundance. 

But the evil has come with the good, and much fine gold has been corroded.With riches has come inexcusable waste. We have squandered a great partof what we might have used, and have not stopped to conserve the exceedingbounty of nature, without which our genius for enterprise would have beenworthless and impotent, scorning to be careful, shamefully prodigal aswell as admirably efficient. We have been proud of our industrial achievements,but we have not hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to count the humancost, the cost of lives snuffed out, of energies overtaxed and broken,the fearful physical and spiritual cost to the men and women and childrenupon whom the dead weight and burden of it all has fallen pitilessly theyears through. The groans and agony of it all had not yet reached our ears,the solemn, moving undertone of our life, coming up out of the mines andfactories, and out of every home where the struggle had its intimate andfamiliar seat. With the great Government went many deep secret things whichwe too long delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid, fearless eyes.The great Government we loved has too often been made use of for privateand selfish purposes, and those who used it had forgotten the people. 

At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We seethe bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and vital.With this vision we approach new affairs. Our duty is to cleanse, to reconsider,to restore, to correct the evil without impairing the good, to purify andhumanize every process of our common life without weakening or sentimentalizingit. There has been something crude and heartless and unfeeling in our hasteto succeed and be great. Our thought has been ""Let every man look out forhimself, let every generation look out for itself,"" while we reared giantmachinery which made it impossible that any but those who stood at thelevers of control should have a chance to look out for themselves. We hadnot forgotten our morals. We remembered well enough that we had set upa policy which was meant to serve the humblest as well as the most powerful,with an eye single to the standards of justice and fair play, and rememberedit with pride. But we were very heedless and in a hurry to be great. 

We have come now to the sober second thought. The scales of heedlessnesshave fallen from our eyes. We have made up our minds to square every processof our national life again with the standards we so proudly set up at thebeginning and have always carried at our hearts. Our work is a work ofrestoration. 

We have itemized with some degree of particularity the things that oughtto be altered and here are some of the chief items: A tariff which cutsus off from our proper part in the commerce of the world, violates thejust principles of taxation, and makes the Government a facile instrumentin the hand of private interests; a banking and currency system based uponthe necessity of the Government to sell its bonds fifty years ago and perfectlyadapted to concentrating cash and restricting credits; an industrial systemwhich, take it on all its sides, financial as well as administrative, holdscapital in leading strings, restricts the liberties and limits the opportunitiesof labor, and exploits without renewing or conserving the natural resourcesof the country; a body of agricultural activities never yet given the efficiencyof great business undertakings or served as it should be through the instrumentalityof science taken directly to the farm, or afforded the facilities of creditbest suited to its practical needs; watercourses undeveloped, waste placesunreclaimed, forests untended, fast disappearing without plan or prospectof renewal, unregarded waste heaps at every mine. We have studied as perhapsno other nation has the most effective means of production, but we havenot studied cost or economy as we should either as organizers of industry,as statesmen, or as individuals. 

Nor have we studied and perfected the means by which government maybe put at the service of humanity, in safeguarding the health of the Nation,the health of its men and its women and its children, as well as theirrights in the struggle for existence. This is no sentimental duty. Thefirm basis of government is justice, not pity. These are matters of justice.There can be no equality or opportunity, the first essential of justicein the body politic, if men and women and children be not shielded in theirlives, their very vitality, from the consequences of great industrial andsocial processes which they can not alter, control, or singly cope with.Society must see to it that it does not itself crush or weaken or damageits own constituent parts. The first duty of law is to keep sound the societyit serves. Sanitary laws, pure food laws, and laws determining conditionsof labor which individuals are powerless to determine for themselves areintimate parts of the very business of justice and legal efficiency. 

These are some of the things we ought to do, and not leave the othersundone, the old-fashioned, never-to-be-neglected, fundamental safeguardingof property and of individual right. This is the high enterprise of thenew day: To lift everything that concerns our life as a Nation to the lightthat shines from the hearthfire of every man's conscience and vision ofthe right. It is inconceivable that we should do this as partisans; itis inconceivable we should do it in ignorance of the facts as they areor in blind haste. We shall restore, not destroy. We shall deal with oureconomic system as it is and as it may be modified, not as it might beif we had a clean sheet of paper to write upon; and step by step we shallmake it what it should be, in the spirit of those who question their ownwisdom and seek counsel and knowledge, not shallow self-satisfaction orthe excitement of excursions whither they can not tell. Justice, and onlyjustice, shall always be our motto. 

And yet it will be no cool process of mere science. The Nation has beendeeply stirred, stirred by a solemn passion, stirred by the knowledge ofwrong, of ideals lost, of government too often debauched and made an instrumentof evil. The feelings with which we face this new age of right and opportunitysweep across our heartstrings like some air out of God's own presence,where justice and mercy are reconciled and the judge and the brother areone. We know our task to be no mere task of politics but a task which shallsearch us through and through, whether we be able to understand our timeand the need of our people, whether we be indeed their spokesmen and interpreters,whether we have the pure heart to comprehend and the rectified will tochoose our high course of action. 

This is not a day of triumph; it is a day of dedication. Here muster,not the forces of party, but the forces of humanity. Men's hearts waitupon us; men's lives hang in the balance; men's hopes call upon us to saywhat we will do. Who shall live up to the great trust? Who dares fail totry? I summon all honest men, all patriotic, all forward-looking men, tomy side. God helping me, I will not fail them, if they will but counseland sustain me! ",Inaugural Address,Democrat,0,1913,"There has been a change of government. It began two years ago, whenthe House of Representatives became Democratic by a decisive majority.It has now been completed. The Senate about to assemble will also be Democratic.The offices of President and Vice-President have been put into the handsof Democrats. What does the change mean? That is the question that is uppermostin our minds to-day. That is the question I am going to try to answer,in order, if I may, to interpret the occasion.  It means much more than the mere success of a party. The success ofa party means little except when the Nation is using that party for a largeand definite purpose. No one can mistake the purpose for which the Nationnow seeks to use the Democratic Party. It seeks to use it to interpreta change in its own plans and point of view. Some old things with whichwe had grown familiar, and which had begun to creep into the very habitof our thought and of our lives, have altered their aspect as we have latterlylooked critically upon them, with fresh, awakened eyes; have dropped theirdisguises and shown themselves alien and sinister. Some new things, aswe look frankly upon them, willing to comprehend their real character,have come to assume the aspect of things long believed in and familiar,stuff of our own convictions. We have been refreshed by a new insight intoour own life.  We see that in many things that life is very great. It is incomparablygreat in its material aspects, in its body of wealth, in the diversityand sweep of its energy, in the industries which have been conceived andbuilt up by the genius of individual men and the limitless enterprise ofgroups of men. It is great, also, very great, in its moral force. Nowhereelse in the world have noble men and women exhibited in more striking formsthe beauty and the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and counsel in theirefforts to rectify wrong, alleviate suffering, and set the weak in theway of strength and hope. We have built up, moreover, a great system ofgovernment, which has stood through a long age as in many respects a modelfor those who seek to set liberty upon foundations that will endure againstfortuitous change, against storm and accident. Our life contains everygreat thing, and contains it in rich abundance.  But the evil has come with the good, and much fine gold has been corroded.With riches has come inexcusable waste. We have squandered a great partof what we might have used, and have not stopped to conserve the exceedingbounty of nature, without which our genius for enterprise would have beenworthless and impotent, scorning to be careful, shamefully prodigal aswell as admirably efficient. We have been proud of our industrial achievements,but we have not hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to count the humancost, the cost of lives snuffed out, of energies overtaxed and broken,the fearful physical and spiritual cost to the men and women and childrenupon whom the dead weight and burden of it all has fallen pitilessly theyears through. The groans and agony of it all had not yet reached our ears,the solemn, moving undertone of our life, coming up out of the mines andfactories, and out of every home where the struggle had its intimate andfamiliar seat. With the great Government went many deep secret things whichwe too long delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid, fearless eyes.The great Government we loved has too often been made use of for privateand selfish purposes, and those who used it had forgotten the people.  At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We seethe bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and vital.With this vision we approach new affairs. Our duty is to cleanse, to reconsider,to restore, to correct the evil without impairing the good, to purify andhumanize every process of our common life without weakening or sentimentalizingit. There has been something crude and heartless and unfeeling in our hasteto succeed and be great. Our thought has been ""Let every man look out forhimself, let every generation look out for itself,"" while we reared giantmachinery which made it impossible that any but those who stood at thelevers of control should have a chance to look out for themselves. We hadnot forgotten our morals. We remembered well enough that we had set upa policy which was meant to serve the humblest as well as the most powerful,with an eye single to the standards of justice and fair play, and rememberedit with pride. But we were very heedless and in a hurry to be great.  We have come now to the sober second thought. The scales of heedlessnesshave fallen from our eyes.

items: a tariff which cutsus off from our proper part in the commerce of the world, violates thejust principles of taxation, and makes the government a facile instrumentin the hand of private interests; a banking and currency system based uponthe necessity of the government to sell its bonds fifty years ago and perfectlyadapted to concentrating cash and restricting credits; an industrial systemwhich, take it on all its sides, financial as well as administrative, holdscapital in leading strings, restricts the liberties and limits the opportunitiesof labor, and exploits without renewing or conserving the natural resourcesof the country; a body of agricultural activities never yet given the efficiencyof great business undertakings or served as it should be through the
